Fishes of the family Antennariidae (order Lophiiformes) are primarily shallow-water benthic forms found
in nearly all tropical and subtropical oceans and seas of the world, with some taxa extending into tem-
perate waters. Despite an earlier attempt based on morphology, no previous hypothesis of intergeneric
relationships of the Antennariidae exists. To resolve phylogenetic relationships within the Antennariidae,
and to test the validity of species groups within Antennarius, DNA sequences from the mitochondrial 16S
and cytochrome oxidase c subunit 1 (COI) genes, and nuclear recombination activating gene 2 (RAG2), for
25 described and four undescribed antennariid species, representing 10 of 12 known genera and one
undescribed genus, were unambiguously aligned and analyzed using Bayesian and maximum likelihood
methods. The markers were partitioned and analyzed for substitution saturation and only the third codon
position of COI (COI-3) was found to have reached saturation. However, analysis of both datasets, one
with the saturated data and one without, differed only slightly. All molecular analyses recovered two
major clades, one comprised of Fowlerichthys, Antennarius, Histrio, and Antennatus; and another contain-
ing Rhycherus, Antennariidae gen. et sp. nov., Kuiterichthys, Phyllophryne, Echinophryne, Tathicarpus,
Lophiocharon, and Histiophryne. Evidence is presented to illustrate a correlation between phylogeny, geo-
graphic distribution, and reproductive life history. The results of these analyses provide the ﬁrst hypoth-
esis of evolutionary relationships within the Antennariidae.

1. Introduction

The lophiiform suborder Antennarioidei constitutes a morpho-
logically diverse assemblage of taxa, nearly all of which are later-
ally compressed, shallow to moderately deepwater, benthic
forms with a host of common names including frogﬁshes, sea-
mice, sea-toads, warty anglerﬁshes, and handﬁshes. The 20 genera
and approximately 63 extant species are distributed among four
families (Pietsch and Grobecker, 1987; Pietsch et al., 2009b): the

Brachionichthyidae, containing ﬁve genera and 14 species (Last
and Gledhill, 2009; Carnevale and Pietsch, 2010); the monotypic
Lophichthyidae (Pietsch, 1981); the Tetrabrachiidae, containing
two genera and two species (Pietsch, 1981; Pietsch et al., 2009b);
and the Antennariidae, containing 12 genera (Figs. 1 and 2) and
approximately 46 extant species (Pietsch and Grobecker, 1987).
They are part of a much larger assemblage of teleost ﬁshes called
the Lophiiformes, characterized most strikingly by the structure
of the ﬁrst dorsal-ﬁn spine (illicium), placed on or near the tip of
the snout and modiﬁed to serve as a luring apparatus for attracting
prey, and gill openings narrowly constricted to form tube-like
structures that open posteriorly behind the base of the pectoral
ﬁn that facilitate jet-propulsive locomotion.

Fishes of the family Antennariidae are found in nearly all trop-
ical and subtropical oceans and seas of the world, with some taxa
extending into temperate waters. They are distinguished from spe-
cies of other antennarioid families by the presence of an enlarged
third dorsal-ﬁn spine (and associated pterygiophore), as well as a
shortened body and a sigmoid vertebral column (see Pietsch,
1981, ﬁgs. 12, 33–35, 41, 1984; Pietsch and Grobecker, 1987).
Antennariids are primarily benthic, sit-and-wait, cryptic predators
that blend in nearly perfectly with almost any combination of
substrate and structure. Several species appear to mimic sponges
(e.g., Antennarius pictus and Antennarius commerson; Wickler,
1968; Pietsch and Grobecker, 1978) while others look nearly iden-
tical to sea urchins (e.g., Astropyga radiata; Schneidewind, 2005).
Although generally sedentary, frogﬁshes employ several modes of

locomotion. One such mode, a unique tetrapod-like locomotion,
is at the heart of myths surrounding the amphibious nature of
these animals, which date back three centuries (Pietsch and
Grobecker, 1987). The ability to remain out of water for an ex-
tended period of time (as many as 3 days) and to move about the
substrate was ﬁrst reported by Renard (1719) and later accepted
as truth by a number of prominent naturalists (e.g., Valenciennes,
1837; Swainson, 1838; see also Pietsch, 1984; Pietsch and
Grobecker, 1987). Frogﬁshes use their jointed, arm- and hand-like
pectoral ﬁns in conjunction with the pelvic ﬁns to accomplish a
kind of locomotion that resembles a ‘‘walk’’ in typical tetrapod-like
fashion. However, the ability to remain out of water for any length
of time, let alone move about without the buoyancy provided by
seawater, is severely restricted. ‘‘A living frogﬁsh removed from

its body more or less immobile and spreading out pancake-like un-
der its own weight’’ (Pietsch and Grobecker, 1987, p. 345).

The Antennariidae has had a long and complex taxonomic his-
tory, beginning with the ﬁrst illustration of a frogﬁsh supplied to
Johannes de Laet by an unknown Dutchman dating sometime prior
to the year 1630. The ﬁrst notable contribution to frogﬁsh biology
was that of Albertus Seba, published in the ﬁrst volume of his Loc-
upletissimus Rerum Naturalium Thesaurus of 1734. Seba, like many
of his contemporaries, believed that antennariids were anuran
amphibians and classiﬁed them with true frogs, referring to them
as Rana Piscatrix, or ‘‘ﬁshing frog.’’

The ﬁrst serious study of antennariid ﬁshes was undertaken
by the French naturalist Philibert Commerson. His manuscripts
and drawings were incorporated by Lacepède in the latter’s His-
toire Naturelle des Poissons (1798). A full treatment of the group
was published by Valenciennes (1837) in the twelfth volume of
the Histoire Naturelle des Poissons. Although Günther (1861) ﬁrst
recognized the problems inherent in frogﬁsh systematics, an at-
tempt to revise the family on a worldwide basis did not appear
until the monograph of Schultz in 1957, and then another mono-
graph by Le Danois (1964). However, until Pietsch (1984) re-
viewed the family, there were 165 nominal species placed in
some 31 nominal genera and subgenera, the descriptive prolifer-
ation resulting in an extremely confusing nomenclature that in-
volved well over 350 different
combinations of generic,

subgeneric, speciﬁc, and varietal names for what was then recog-
nized as 40 valid species. Pietsch (1984) split the most diverse
antennariid genus, Antennarius, into six species groups (Fig. 3):
the A. biocellatus group, A. nummifer group, A. ocellatus group,
A. pauciradiatus group, A. pictus group, and A. striatus group. In
addition, Pietsch (1984) provided geographic distributions, depth
ranges, and the ﬁrst taxonomic keys. His cladistic analysis of
morphological characters, however, did not produce a fully re-
solved hypothesis of relationships within the family. In particu-
lar, monophyly for the 24 species of Antennarius was not
established and no group of two or more genera was found to
possess any convincing synapomorphy that did not also occur
within lophiiform taxa lying outside the group in question.

The lack of phylogenetic insight drawn from morphological data
required that some other dataset, namely molecular sequence data,
be analyzed to address the evolutionary relationships of the Anten-
nariidae. To this end, sequences were assembled from 25 described
and four undescribed antennariid species representing 10 of 12
known genera and one undescribed genus. A dataset of 1709 bps
from the genes 16S, cytochrome oxidase c subunit 1 (COI), and
recombination activation gene 2 (RAG2) were analyzed using
Bayesian and maximum likelihood methods to address the interge-
neric relationships of the family and to test the validity of the spe-
cies groups of Antennarius hypothesized by Pietsch (1984). The
results of this study provide the ﬁrst hypothesis of evolutionary
relationships within the Antennariidae.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Taxon sampling

Because the monophyletic status of the Antennariidae has been
demonstrated previously (Pietsch, 1981), and because the purpose
of this study was to determine intergeneric relationships and not
to test monophyly of the family, only two genera of the purported
sister family Tetrabrachiidae (Pietsch, 1981; Pietsch et al., 2009b),
Dibrachichthys and Tetrabrachium, were included as outgroup taxa.
This strategy minimizes the potential occurrence of substitution
saturation present in datasets representing highly divergent taxa.
DNA sequences were analyzed from 31 species including two
outgroup taxa and 47 individual antennariids from 10 of the 12
currently recognized genera (Table 1). An undescribed species
from New South Wales, Australia, which represents a new
genus, was also included. Nudiantennarius, a monotypic genus rep-
resented by only four specimens in collections worldwide, and
Allenichthys, a monotypic genus endemic to Western Australia,
were not included because tissues were unavailable. All polytypic
genera, except Antennarius, were assumed to be monophyletic.
Representatives of four of the six species groups of Antennarius

(Pietsch, 1984), the A. nummifer group, A. ocellatus group, A. pictus
group, and A. striatus group, were included in this study. The A.
biocellatus group, consisting of one species, and the A. pauciradiatus
group, comprising two species, were not included because tissues
were unavailable.

For the following species, data were generated from tissue sam-
ples from more than one individual: A. pictus (Shaw), A. striatus
(Shaw), Antennatus tuberosus (Cuvier), Histrio histrio (Linnaeus),
Histiophryne cryptacanthus (Weber), Kuiterichthys furcipilis (Cuvier),
Lophiocharon lithinostomus (Jordan and Richardson), Phyllophryne
scortea (McCulloch and Waite), Rhycherus ﬁlamentosus (Castelnau),
and Tathicarpus butleri Ogilby. For all other species, one individual
was included in the data set. Voucher specimens have been re-
tained for all samples. A complete list of taxa, catalog numbers
for vouchers and tissues, and GenBank accession numbers are pre-
sented in Table 1.

2.2. DNA extractions, PCR ampliﬁcation, and sequencing

Genomic DNA was extracted from approximately 25 mg of eth-
anol-ﬁxed skeletal muscle or ﬁn tissue using a Qiagen DNeasy tis-
sue extraction kit. Both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA were used

because, ultimately, the mitochondrial genome is a single linked
locus that can provide just one perspective on the evolutionary his-
tory of species (Zhang and Hewitt, 2003; Ballard and Whitlock,
2004) and is often inadequate for phylogenetic analyses (Chan
and Levin, 2005). Aliquots (2.0 ll) of genomic DNA were used as
template in all polymerase chain reactions (PCR) to amplify dou-
ble-stranded DNA product from two mitochondrial genes, 16S
and cytochrome oxidase c subunit 1 (COI), and one nuclear gene,
recombination activating gene 2 (RAG2). All PCR reactions were
carried out using a Peltier Thermal Cycler (PT-225), each with a to-
tal volume of 25 ll with the following concentrations of reagents:
2 ll of genomic DNA isolate, 1.25 ll of each 10 lM primer, 2.5 ll of
10X buffer, 1.25 ll of 25 mM MgCl2, 0.625 ll of 8 mM premixed
deoxynucleotide triphosphates, and 1.0 U of Biolase Taq Polymer-
ase (Bioline).

The universal primer pair 16Sar and 16Sbr (Palumbi, 1996) was
used to PCR amplify an approximately 650 base pair (bp) fragment

of the mitochondrial rDNA gene 16S using the following protocol:
initial denaturation at 94 °C for 2 min followed by 30 cycles of
denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 56 °C for 30 s, and
extension at 72 °C for 45 s. After a ﬁnal extension step at 72 °C
for 10 min, all samples were held at 4 °C.

An approximately 700 bp fragment of the 50 region of the pro-
tein-coding mitochondrial COI gene was PCR ampliﬁed with pri-
mer pairs COI5562f and COI6284r
(Pietsch et al., 2009a).
Ampliﬁcation of the COI gene for one species, A. tuberosus, was
problematic and a new reverse primer was designed using se-
quences of antennariids ampliﬁed with the initial primer pair.
These sequences were aligned in MUSCLE (multiple sequence com-
parison by log-expectation, Edgar, 2004) and 21 bp sequences were
copied from a conserved region at the 30 ends of the gene: COIr 50-
CRG CYT STT CRA ATG TGT GRT-30. Using these primer pairs, the
COI gene was ampliﬁed utilizing the same protocol for 16S ampli-
ﬁcation, except for the annealing temperature that was 52–54 °C.

Primer pair RAG2-f2 and RAG2-r3 (Westneat and Alfaro, 2005)
was used to PCR amplify an approximately 490 bp fragment from
the protein-coding region of RAG2 using the touchdown thermocy-
cle protocol (Palumbi, 1996). All samples were then held at 4 °C.
PCR products were visualized on 1–2% agarose gels and bands of
the target fragment length were cut directly from the gel and
cleaned using QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen). Forward and
reverse sequences were generated at
the High-Throughput
Genomics Unit (HTGU), Department of Genome Sciences, Univer-
sity of Washington, Seattle.

2.3. Sequence editing, alignment, and substitution saturation

All forward and reverse chromatographs were aligned in GENE-
IOUS (Drummond et al., 2007) and checked against each other for
base pair calls. Instances of heterozygosity (overlapping peaks of
equal strength) for the RAG2 sequences were coded according to
the IUPAC ambiguity code. None of the heterozygous sites coded
for alternative amino acids.

All sequences were aligned using MUSCLE (Edgar, 2004) as
implemented in GENEIOUS (Drummond et al., 2007) using the full
gap penalty. 16S fragments were further aligned manually accord-
ing to the proposed secondary structure of Polyipnus matsubarai
16S rRNA, reference sequence GenBank D89739 (Miya and Nishida,
1998). Sequences were trimmed according to the reference. The ﬁ-
nal length was 521 bps (246 phylogenetically informative sites),
with 330 bps of loop region and 191 bps of stem region.

The two protein coding loci, COI and RAG2, were also aligned
against reference sequence. To check the reading frame for COI, se-
quences were aligned against a known sequence of Antennarius
avalonis (GenBank DQ027984.1), and the sequences were trimmed
to a ﬁnal length of 699 bps (229 phylogenetically informative
sites). RAG2 sequences were aligned against a known sequence
of Balistes capriscus (GenBank DQ874786.1) to conﬁrm the reading
frame as well as determine the presence of indels (insertions or
deletions). No indels were found. The ﬁnal length of the RAG2 frag-
ment was 489 bps (130 informative sites).

Sequences of variable lengths introduced cells of missing data
in the ﬁnal matrix. These sites were coded as ambiguous for all
analyses. All sequences were deposited in GenBank; their accession
numbers and corresponding whole specimen vouchers are listed in
Table 1.

Nucleotide substitution saturation was examined in DAMBE
(Xia and Xie, 2001) using corrected genetic distances plotted
against transitions and transversions for all pairwise comparisons
among taxa. 16S stems and loops as well as ﬁrst, second, and third
codon positions of COI and RAG2 were analyzed separately. Sec-
ond-order polynomial curves were ﬁt to the data, and saturation
was established when the curve reached a plateau.

2.4. Phylogenetic analyses

To determine phylogenetic relationships and the effect of the
saturated data on topology and clade support, Bayesian and

codon position of COI). Branch lengths are measured in expected substitutions per site and are proportional to length. Numbers above nodes are posterior probabilities and

bootstrap percentage of 100.

maximum likelihood analyses of two datasets were performed. The
ﬁrst dataset included all sequences produced for 16S stems, 16S
loops, COI, and RAG2; the other differed only in the removal of
the third codon position of COI, which was saturated with substi-
tutions. To determine which nucleotide substitution model was
most appropriate, 16S stems, 16S loops, the ﬁrst and second codon
positions of COI (COI-12), all codon positions of COI (COI-123), and
RAG2 were analyzed separately using ModelTest 3.7 (Posada and
Crandall, 1998) under the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC).
Those models were used in all further phylogenetics analyses. All
Bayesian analyses were carried out in MrBayes 3.1.2 (Huelsenbeck
and Ronquist, 2001; Ronquist and Huelsenbeck, 2003) and each
dataset was partitioned to accommodate differences among genes
and the stem and loop regions of the 16S gene fragment. The par-
titions are summarized as follows: K80 + I + G for 16S stems, SY-
M + I + G for 16S loops, TrN + I + G for COI-12, TIM + I + G for COI-
123, and TrN + I for RAG2. Sequences were partitioned in Mesquite
(Maddison and Maddison, 2009), and all partitions unlinked.

For analyses of both datasets, the default setting of ﬂat priors for
the transition/transversion rate ratio, branch length, alpha param-
eter of the gamma distribution for rate heterogeneity, proportion
of invariant sites, base frequencies, and tree topology parameters

were all used except for the 16S stems and 16S loops partitions
that had ﬁxed nucleotide frequencies. To ensure convergence,
5,000,000 generations were run with two replicates, each with four
simultaneous chains, three hot, one cold, with trees sampled every
100 generations. Stationarity was achieved, as indicated by the
standard deviation of split frequencies and examination of a graph
of posterior probability versus replicates. Of the resulting 50,001
trees, 12,500 were discarded as burn-in. A 50% majority rule con-
sensus tree was constructed of the post burn-in trees.

Concatenated datasets (one with COI-12 and one with COI-123)
were used for the maximum likelihood (ML) analyses in PHYML
(Guiden and Gascuel, 2003) as implemented in GENEIOUS
(Drummond et al., 2007) utilizing the GTR + I + G model of nucleo-
tide substitution. This model was chosen because it is all-inclusive,
containing the ﬁve parameters estimated by the HKY model. Boot-
strapping of the datasets was carried out with 500 pseudorepli-
cates, and all node values for the ML trees are represented as the
proportion of replicates in which that clade was recovered. In all
ML and Bayesian analyses, Tetrabrachium ocellatum was designated
as the outgroup, resulting in rooted phylogenetic trees with a poly-
tomy at the base. Gene trees were also analyzed separately using
maximum likelihood analysis with 100 bootstrap pseudoreplicates.

Nucleotide substitution models for the gene trees are summarized
as follows: GTR + I + G for 16S, TIM + I + G for COI, and TrN + I for
RAG2.

3. Results

3.1. The effects of substitution saturation on clade support and
topology

As expected, loop mutations and synonymous changes were
in the greatest abundance; however, only the third codon posi-
tion of COI reached saturation. To evaluate the effect of the sat-
urated data on tree topologies and clade support, two datasets
(one with the saturated data and one without) were analyzed
and compared.

Of the 1709 sites included in the total evidence data set, 662
were variable, with the saturated sites providing 35% of the infor-
mative sites. With the exception of the A. pictus group, the exclu-
sion of the saturated data from further phylogenetic analysis did
not change tree topology. In the Bayesian analysis (BA) tree utiliz-
ing saturated data (Figs. 4 and 5), A. maculatus is sister to A. multio-
cellatus (Posterior Probability P = 0.98), and they as a group are
sister to A. pictus (P = 1.00). In the BA tree excluding the saturated
data (Figs. 6 and 7), A. maculatus is sister to A. pictus (P = 1.00), and
they as a group are sister to A. multiocellatus (P = 1.00). Clade sup-
port values were affected only slightly by the removal of the satu-
rated data; in six instances, decreased posterior probabilities (PPs)

were found in the Bayesian tree that excluded the saturated data,
but usually from 1.00 to P0.93, and in three instances PPs in-
creased in support 60.09.

It is evident that PPs and bootstrap values at some nodes are
discordant. It is possible that this is caused by the concatenation
of the data. Partitioning the genes, including the stems and loops
regions of 16S, with their own gamma distribution and alpha
parameter allows for a better ﬁt. It is likely that an appropriate par-
titioning scheme for the ML analyses would reduce the effects of
the saturation and noise in the reconstruction of those nodes with
low bootstrap supports.

3.2. Phylogenetic relationships within the family Antennariidae

Two major clades were recovered in both analyses (Figs. 4–7),
the ﬁrst composed of the subfamily Antennariinae, containing gen-
era Fowlerichthys (resurrected from the synonymy of Antennarius),
Antennarius, Histrio, and Antennatus; and a sister clade, subfamily
Histiophryninae, containing the remaining genera Rhycherus,
Antennariidae gen. et sp. nov., Kuiterichthys, Phyllophryne, Echin-
ophryne, Tathicarpus, Lophiocharon, and Histiophryne. The Histioph-
ryninae is deﬁned as including all members of the Antennariidae
that have lost the mesopterygoid and epural. Within the Anten-
nariinae (Figs. 4 and 6), Antennarius was rendered paraphyletic
(requiring resurrection and recognition of Fowlerichthys Barbour,
1941, to contain the former members of the Antennarius ocellatus
group sensu Pietsch and Grobecker, 1987:111). At the same time,

Antennatus was recovered nested within the Antennarius nummifer
group, requiring reallocation of all members of the latter (as recog-
nized by Pietsch and Grobecker, 1987), resulting in a much ex-
panded Antennatus. While it is tempting to erect subgenera to
separate Antennatus sensu stricto from the former members of the
A. nummifer group, such action is postponed until more detailed
analysis of this assemblage is possible.

sp. nov., Kuiterichthys, Phyllophryne, and Echinophryne. Tathicarpus
was recovered as sister to a clade containing Lophiocharon and His-
tiophryne. Phyllophryne and Echinophryne were recovered as sister
taxa, as were Kuiterichthys and Antennariidae gen. et sp. nov. These
two groups and Rhycherus were recovered in a polytomy. Tathicar-
pus is recovered as sister to a clade containing Lophiocharon and
Histiophryne.

The A. pictus group was recovered as monophyletic, but Fowle-
richthys (=the A. ocellatus group) was found to be monophyletic
only to the exclusion of A. indicus, a species recovered as sister of
the monophyletic A. striatus group. The A. pictus group was sister
to the A. striatus group, together forming the sister group of the
genus Histrio. The A. pictus group, A. striatus group, and Histrio com-
prise a clade sister of the now expanded Antennatus. Fowlerichthys
was recovered as sister to all species groups of Antennarius plus
Antennatus and Histrio, and is
the

The Histiophryninae was subdivided into two groups (Figs. 5
and 7), the ﬁrst containing Tathicarpus, Lophiocharon, and Histioph-

3.3. A comparison of gene trees

With the exception of unresolved clades, gene trees did not dif-
fer notably in topology. In fact, all intergeneric relationships recov-
ered in the combined data set were in agreement with all gene
trees except in the case of RAG2, in which an individual of K. furcip-
ilis was recovered as sister of Antennariidae gen. et sp. nov., while a
different specimen of K. furcipilis was recovered as the sister to
them. While unresolved in the combined data set analyses, both
the RAG2 and 16S gene trees recovered Rhycherus as basal to the
sister genera Phyllophryne and Echinophryne. In the 16S gene tree,
with the exception of A. commerson, the A. pictus group was

recovered as sister to a clade containing the remaining species of
Antennarius, Antennatus, and Histrio, while in the combined data
set it was recovered as sister to the A. striatus group, and included
A. commerson.

4. Discussion

4.1. Morphological evidence

While Pietsch (1984) and Pietsch and Grobecker (1987) were
not able to resolve relationships within the Antennariidae, mor-
phological characters found in their studies correspond with clades
recovered in this study. For instance, within the Antennariinae,
Fowlerichthys has a unique combination of 20 vertebrae and ﬁve
bifurcate pelvic-ﬁn rays, while members of the second clade
(Antennatus, Histrio, A. pictus group, and A. striatus group) have
19 vertebrae and one bifurcate pelvic-ﬁn ray. Members of the His-
tiophryninae (Figs. 5 and 7) have lost the mesopterygoid and epur-
al, a point which also led Pietsch (1984) and Pietsch and Grobecker
(1987) to conclude that this lineage likely forms a monophyletic
group. Lophiocharon and Histiophryne were recovered as sister
groups and are the only antennariids that have lost pharyngobran-
chial I (this element is also absent in brachionichthyids and some
ogcocephalids; Pietsch, 1984; Pietsch and Grobecker, 1987).

4.2. Phylogenetic position of Fowlerichthys

As seen in Figs. 4 and 6, Fowlerichthys (containing remnants of
the previously recognized A. ocellatus group; sensu Pietsch and Gro-
becker, 1987) was recovered as the sister group of the paraphyletic
genus Antennarius. The members of this species group, F. avalonis,
F. ocellatus, F. radiosus, F. senegalensis, and F. scriptissimus (exclud-
ing A. indicus), share a character unique among lophiiforms in hav-
ing all ﬁve pelvic-ﬁn rays bifurcate (all other antennariids have
four simple and one bifurcate rays). They also have 20 vertebrae
while nearly all other antennariids examined within the Anten-
nariinae have 19 (the two exceptions noted by Pietsch (1984) are
a single specimen of A. striatus, having 18 vertebrae, and a single
specimen of A. commerson, with 20 vertebrae). Furthermore, F.
radiosus has an unusual early life-history stage called the ‘‘scuta-
tus’’ prejuvenile form. This stage is characterized by a pair of
shield-like bony extensions of the cranium that reach beyond the
level of the opercular bones, and an expansion of the anterior mar-
gin of the bones of the suspensorium (see Pietsch and Grobecker,
1987, Figs. 43 and 44). This early life-history stage was so strange,
in fact, that it was originally described as a new genus and species,
Kanazawaichthys scutatus, by Schultz (1957), and only later shown
by Hubbs (1958) to be the prejuvenile of F. radiosus (see Pietsch
and Grobecker, 1987). Although a similar morphological adapta-
tion in closely related species was expected, Pietsch (1984) found
nothing comparable upon examination of a 19.0-mm SL F. ocellatus
and 12.0-mm SL F. avalonis. However, Adams (1960) found that in
Histrio histrio, 10.0-mm SL marked the transition from postlarva to
juvenile and by 15.5-mm SL the specimens had taken on full adult
appearances. While larval antennariids are not rare in collections,
rapid metamorphosis from larvae to adult may severely limit the
number of available prejuveniles for examination.

Even without knowing which species pass through the scutatus
prejuvenile form, Fowlerichthys is markedly different from all other
species of Antennarius, Antennatus, and Histrio. For the reasons dis-
cussed above, the genus Fowlerichthys Barbour (1941), type species
F. ﬂoridanus (a junior synonym of A. radiosus Garman, 1896), is ap-
plied to the previously recognized A. ocellatus group (excluding A.
indicus, see below).

4.3. Phylogenetic position of Antennarius indicus

With the exception of the placement of A. indicus, all species of
Antennarius included in this study were recovered within the same
species groups of Antennarius hypothesized by Pietsch (1984). A.
indicus was recovered as the basal species of Fowlerichthys (previ-
ously the A. ocellatus group) in the morphological study by Pietsch
(1984), while it is here recovered as sister to the A. striatus group
(Figs. 4 and 6).

Some characters of A. indicus overlap with the diagnostic fea-
tures of Fowlerichthys and the A. striatus group. For example, the
membrane behind the second dorsal-ﬁn spine is divided into
naked dorsal and ventral portions by a dense cluster of dermal
denticles in Fowlerichthys, while this division is absent in the A.
striatus group. Specimens of A. indicus usually lack a divided mem-
brane behind the second dorsal-ﬁn spine, or at most, it is only
weakly divided (Pietsch, 1984). In Fowlerichthys, the ventral por-
tion of the membrane usually extends posteriorly, dividing the de-
pressed area between the bases of the second and third dorsal-ﬁn
spines and nearly reaches to the base of the third; the membrane
behind the second dorsal-ﬁn spine in A. indicus terminates dis-
tinctly anterior to the third dorsal-ﬁn spine, as it does in the A. stri-
atus group. The anterior end of the pterygiophore of the illicium
nearly always extends anteriorly beyond the symphysis of the
upper jaw in the A. striatus group, a feature thought to be unique
among lophiiforms by Pietsch and Grobecker (1987). Despite the
fact that specimens of A. indicus have never been recognized as
having an overhanging pterygiophore, all specimens examined in
this study have pterygiophores extending anteriorly beyond the
symphysis of the upper jaw.

The pigment pattern of A. indicus also overlaps with both spe-
cies groups. Fowlerichthys has 1–3 darkly pigmented ocelli on each
side of the body while the A. striatus group lacks ocelli; A. indicus
generally has 2–3 ocelli. The A. striatus group usually has darkly
pigmented streaks or elongate blotches on the body (Fig. 3C) with
similar markings on the soft-dorsal, caudal, and anal ﬁns. However,
markings are completely absent in some specimens, while recent
unpublished photographs depict specimens that have blotchy,
somewhat circular markings (Fig. 3D). Elongate blotches also occur
along the posterior margin of the soft-dorsal and anal ﬁns of A.
indicus (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, A. striatus, A. hispidus, and A. indicus
all have numerous darkly pigmented blotchy markings on the pec-
toral and pelvic ﬁns (Fig. 3B D). These markings do not occur in
any other member of Fowlerichthys.

Meristics support inclusion of A. indicus in the A. striatus group
as well. Most or all of the rays of the dorsal ﬁn, and all ﬁve rays of
the pelvic ﬁn, are bifurcate in Fowlerichthys (the latter feature un-
ique among the Lophiiformes), except for A. indicus, for which only
the posteriormost two or three are bifurcate. Members of the A.
striatus group have as many as four of the posteriormost dorsal-
ﬁn rays bifurcate. All members of Fowlerichthys have 20 vertebrae
except A. indicus, which has only 19 vertebrae. All members of the
A. striatus group, and all members of other species groups of Anten-
narius, have 19 vertebrae, with the exception of a single specimen
of A. striatus, noted to have 18 vertebrae, and a single specimen of
A. commerson, noted to have 20 vertebrae (Pietsch and Grobecker,
1987).

Pietsch (1984) stated that A. indicus is the ‘‘least specialized
member’’ of his A. ocellatus group (=Fowlerichthys), and that the
remaining ﬁve species form a monophyletic assemblage on the ba-
sis of having all ﬁve rays of the pelvic ﬁn, and most or all of the rays
of the dorsal ﬁn, bifurcate, and having relatively high vertebral and
dorsal-ﬁn ray counts. Whereas A. indicus shares characteristics
with both species groups, most characters exclude it from Fowle-
richthys and support the molecular analyses for inclusion in the
A. striatus group. These include an overhanging pterygiophore of

R.J. Arnold, T.W. Pietsch / Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution 62 (2012) 117–129

127

the illicium, 19 vertebrae, only the posteriormost pelvic-ﬁn ray
bifurcate, elongated blotches on the dorsal and anal ﬁns, and the
membrane behind the second dorsal-ﬁn spine lacking a clear divi-
sion of distinct clusters of dermal spinules. A. indicus is, therefore,
removed from Fowlerichthys and placed within the A. striatus
group.

4.4. Interrelationships of the A. striatus group

A single specimen of Antennarius hispidus, acquired through the
aquarium trade, but purportedly collected in Indonesia, rendered
A. striatus paraphyletic (Figs. 4 and 6). Tissues from A. striatus orig-
inated from three geographic locations: off the Louisiana coast in
the Gulf of Mexico, US; Tosa Bay, Ko¯ chi Prefecture, Japan; and Ex-
mouth Gulf, Western Australia. Until Pietsch and Grobecker (1987)
placed 28 nominal forms within the synonymy of A. striatus, the
Western Atlantic population had been recognized as A. scaber
and much of the known material from the Western Paciﬁc as A. tri-
dens. The molecular analyses suggest that these previously synon-
ymized species do in fact represent distinct species. However, a
number of authors have reported an excess of silent substitutions
in mtDNA, providing strong evidence of selection on mitochondria
or mitochondrial cellular interactions (reviewed by Gerber et al.
2001), and in many instances mtDNA is probably not selectively
neutral (Ballard and Kreitman, 1995; Gerber et al., 2001; Rand,
2001; Ballard and Whitlock, 2004; Ballard and Rand, 2005). Be-
cause the tips of the tree are based primarily on mtDNA, and
although there is some support from the nuDNA for A. hispidus ren-
dering A. striatus paraphyletic, more evidence is needed from faster
evolving nuclear markers, in particular, before these populations
can be deﬁnitively recognized as distinct.

4.5. Phylogenetic position of Antennatus

Antennatus was introduced by Schultz (1957), but the type spe-
cies, Antennatus strigatus, was originally described as a member of
the genus Antennarius by Gill (1863). The only characters that dif-
ferentiate members of Antennatus from those of Antennarius are the
absence of a pseudobranch and the lack of small naked areas be-
tween the pores of the acoustico-lateralis system (Pietsch and Gro-
becker, 1987). However, it shares with members of the A. nummifer
group a smaller maximum body size compared to most other spe-
cies groups of Antennarius (the A. pauciradiatus group being a nota-
ble exception), and the second dorsal-ﬁn spine free, not connected
to the head by a membrane. Within the Antennariinae, Antennarius
coccineus, A. sanguineus, A. bermudensis, and all species of Antenna-
tus (as recognized by Pietsch and Grobecker, 1987) lack a caudal
peduncle, the membranous posteriormost margin of the soft-dor-
sal and anal ﬁns being connected to the body at the base of the out-
ermost rays of the caudal ﬁn. Of those species included in the
molecular analyses, all form a clade whose members make up
the A. nummifer group and the genus Antennatus (Figs. 4 and 6).
All molecular analyses place the A. nummifer group and Antennatus
in a group sister to a clade consisting of Histrio and the remaining
species groups of Antennarius. Therefore, the A. nummifer group is
hereby removed from the genus Antennarius. Because it is already
in use, the generic designation Antennatus Schultz, 1957, is applied
to this group. Members of Antennatus fall conveniently into two
groups: the A. tuberosus group (new name), comprised of A. tubero-
sus, A. strigatus, A. ﬂagellatus, and A. linearis, have relatively thick
skin, short close-set dermal denticles, all rays of the caudal ﬁn
bifurcate, and a shorter, smaller caudal ﬁn; and members of the
A. nummifer group, comprised of A. nummifer, A. coccineus, A.

bermudensis, A. sanguineus, A. duescus, A. analis, A. dorehensis, and
A. rosaceus, with a darkly pigmented basidorsal spot nearly always
present, dorsal ﬁn with as many as six (usually only three) poste-
riormost rays bifurcate, and the posterior surface of the second
dorsal spine usually devoid of dermal denticles (Pietsch and Gro-
becker, 1987).

Histrio is retained by the removal of the A. ocellatus and A.
nummifer groups. Several characters, including exceptionally long
pelvic ﬁns (length greater than 25% SL), two cutaneous cirri on
the mid-dorsal line of the snout between symphysis of premaxilla
and base of illicium, and a pseudo-pelagic lifestyle (Pietsch and
Grobecker, 1987), require that Histrio be recognized as distinct
from the A. pictus, A. striatus, A. pauciradiatus, and A. biocellatus
groups.

4.6. Phylogenetic positions of the A. pauciradiatus and A. biocellatus
groups

The A. pauciradiatus and A. biocellatus groups have characters
unique to the Antennariidae: in the monotypic A. biocellatus group,
the second dorsal spine is free, not connected to the head by mem-
brane, nearly always straight and tapering distally to a point; and,
most peculiarly, the ability to live in brackish and even fresh
waters (Pietsch and Grobecker, 1987); members of the A. paucirad-
iatus group are paedomorphic forms that reach a maximum length
of only 40 mm; in addition, they have a membranous connection of
the third dorsal-ﬁn spine to the soft dorsal ﬁn (Pietsch and Grobec-
ker, 1987). There are no known morphological characters that
unite either of these groups with any other species group of Anten-
narius, nor to Fowlerichthys, Histrio, or Antennatus (including the A.
nummifer group). Vertebral counts (19) along with four simple and
one bifurcate pelvic-ﬁn rays suggest their placement somewhere
within the lineage containing Antennarius, Antennatus, and Histrio
(Figs. 4 and 6), but until adequate morphological and/or molecular
data are analyzed, their placement within this lineage remains un-
known and designated incertae sedis.

4.7. Phylogenetic position of Nudiantennarius

Nudiantennarius was not included in the molecular analyses be-
cause tissue was unavailable. A combination of morphological and
meristic characters, including presence of the mesopterygoid and
epural, 19 vertebrae, and a single bifurcate pelvic-ﬁn ray (Pietsch,
1984) suggests its position in the lineage containing Antennarius,
Antennatus, and Histrio within the Antennariinae (Figs. 4 and 6). Be-
yond this, its placement is unresolved and designated herein as
Antennariinae incertae sedis.

4.8. Phylogenetic position of Allenichthys

Although Allenichthys was not included in the molecular analy-
ses, its ovarian morphology and endemism in Western Australia,
usually above about 35°S latitude, suggests its placement within
the Histiophryninae (Figs. 5 and 7), in the clade containing Tathi-
carpus, Lophiocharon, and Histiophryne (see Section 4.10, below).
A single record of Allenichthys from South Australia, captured near
Port Lincoln, on 9 January 1967, is likely a result of dispersal via the
Leeuwin and Zeehan currents. The Leeuwin Current ﬂows down
and around the Western Australian coast where it meets the Zee-
han Current, which ﬂows along the continental slope from the
Great Australian Bight to Tasmania. The combination of the Leeu-
win and Zeehan currents can bring tropical species well into south-
ern coastal waters (Gomon et al., 2008).

4.10. Life history and geographic distribution

The Antennariinae, containing Fowlerichthys, Antennarius, Histri-
o, and Antennatus, has a relatively wide geographic distribution,
with all genera found circumglobally throughout the tropics and
subtropics. The Histiophryninae, containing Rhycherus, Antennarii-
dae gen. et sp. nov., Kuiterichthys, Phyllophryne, Echinophryne,
Tathicarpus, Lophiocharon, and Histiophryne, is restricted to the
Indo-Australian Archipelago, a region that extends from Taiwan
to Tasmania, including all of the inland seas and islands of the Phil-
ippines, Indonesia, New Guinea, the Solomons, and the continent of
Australia. Within the Histiophryninae, the clade containing Rhy-
cherus, Kuiterichthys, Antennariidae gen. et sp. nov., Phyllophryne,
and Echinophryne is restricted to temperate waters of Australia, be-
low approximately 30°S latitude. The second clade, containing
Tathicarpus, Lophiocharon, and Histiophryne, extends from the Phil-
ippines to approximately 35°S latitude, except for Histiophryne,
which ranges from Taiwan to the temperate waters of southern
Australia.

Reproductive life history also differs considerably between the
two clades: the Antennariinae has double scroll-shaped ovaries de-
scribed in detail by Rasquin (1958; see also Pietsch and Grobecker,
1987, pl. 10, Fig. 161), while the Histiophryninae has an entirely
different type of ovary. In addition, each ovarian type corresponds
to a different life history: members of the Antennariinae are broad-
cast spawners and go through a distinct larval stage, while those of
the Histiophryninae undergo direct development and display vari-
ous degrees of parental care. The details of ovarian morphology,
life history, and associated behavior will be described in a future
publication.
