Abstract

Psilorhynchus robustus, new species, is described from the Ataran River drainage, Myanmar. It is distinguished by the
presence of a large dark blotch situated posterodorsal to opercle opening, the upper lip separated from the rostral cap by
a shallow groove, and 9 branched dorsal-fin rays. The status of Psilorhynchoides Yazdani, Singh & Rao is discussed. 

Key words: Cypriniformes, Psilorhynchidae, Psilorhynchus, taxonomy, Myanmar

Introduction

Members of the genus Psilorhynchus McClelland are small cypriniform fishes  with arched backs and  flat-
tened ventral surfaces, which are common inhabitants of the streams of the Ganges-Brahmaputra drainage of
Bangladesh, India, Eastern Nepal and adjacent China and the Irrawaddy drainage in northern Myanmar and
southwestern Yunnan (Rainboth, 1983; Vishwanath & Manojkumar, 1995). Seven species of Psilorhynchus
are recognized: P. sucatio (Hamilton, 1822), P. balitora (Hamilton, 1822), P. homaloptera Hora and Mukerji,
1935, P. pseudecheneis Menon and Datta, 1964, P. gracilis Rainboth, 1983, P. microphthalmus Vishwanath
and Manojkumar, 1995 and P. arunachalensis (Nebeshwar, Bagra & Das, 2007). Herein, we describe a new
species of Psilorhynchus from the headwaters of the Ataran River basin, Myanmar.

Material and methods

Measurements and counts generally follow Hubbs & Lagler (1958). Measurements were taken on the left side
with digital callipers to the nearest 0.1 mm. Our counts and measurements differ from Rainboth (1983) in sev-
eral aspects and thus values provided here may not be strictly comparable with that work. In particular, we
prefer to count the small posteriormost ray of the dorsal and anal fins articulating with the same pterygiophore
as the preceding ray as one (vs. counting the last two unbranched rays articulating with the same pterygio-
phore in the dorsal and anal fins as one) and measure head length (HL) in the traditional fashion, from the tip
of the snout to the posterior most point of the opercle (following Hubbs and Lagler, 1958). Selected specimens
were cleared and doubled stained (c&s) for bone and cartilage study (Taylor and van Dyke, 1985). All fin ray
counts, excluding those provided for P. microphthalmus and P. arunachalensis, were confirmed through the
examination of cleared and stained specimens. Vertebral counts are based on c&s specimens and include the
four Weberian centra. Values for the recently described P. arunachalensis are taken from Nebeshwar et al.

CMK 17941, 32 (3 cleared and stained); 49.1–68.1 mm SL; same data as holotype, March 2003.

Diagnosis: Psilorhynchus robustus is most similar to P. gracilis and  P. balitora in overall body shape,
meristics and colour pattern. It is distinguished from both species by the presence of a large dark blotch situ-
ated posterodorsally to opercle opening, extending along lateral-line scales 3–6 (vs. absence) and in having
upper lip separated from the rostral cap by a shallow groove (vs. upper lip separated from rostral cap by a deep
groove). It is further distinguished from P. gracilis by a greater mouth width (28–31 % HL vs. 20–25), head
width (67–73 % HL vs. 56–61), head depth (55–58 % HL vs. 46–50), pre-pelvic distance (53–56 % SL vs.
47–50), pre-anal distance (78–83 % SL vs. 76–79), and caudal peduncle width (5–6 % SL vs. 3–4). Psilorhyn-
chus robustus is distinguished from P. arunachalensis, P. homaloptera, P. microphthalmus, P. pseudecheneis
and P. sucatio in having 9 branched dorsal fin rays (vs. 8). It is further distinguished from P. microphthalmus,
P. arunachalensis, P. homaloptera and P. pseudecheneis by the lower number of unbranched pectoral rays (5
vs. 7 in P. microphthalmus, 8–9 in P. arunachalensis and P. homaloptera and 9–10 in P. pseudecheneis) and
lateral  line  scales  (32–34  vs.  39–40  in  P.  microphthalmus,  42–44  in  P.  arunachalensis,  43–44  in  P.  homa-
loptera  and  46–48  in  P.  pseudecheneis)  and  from  P.  homaloptera  and  P.  pseudecheneis  by  a  greater  body
depth (19–23 % SL vs. 10–15 in P. homaloptera and 13–16 in P. pseudecheneis) and head depth (55–58 % HL
vs. 41–45.5 in P. homaloptera and 38–42 in P. pseudecheneis). 

Description: General body shape as in Figure 1. Morphometric and meristic data are listed in Tables 1–2.
Body high, greatest depth at dorsal-fin origin. Dorsal profile arched, rising gradually to dorsal-fin origin, slop-
ing steeply towards caudal peduncle. Ventral profile straight, from lower jaw to caudal-fin base. 

Dorsal fin with iii. 9 rays. Anal fin with ii.6 rays. Branched caudal-fin rays 8-9+8-9 (8+8 in holotype),
dorsal procurrent rays 5 or 6, ventral procurrent rays 6. Pelvic-fin rays ii.7 pectoral-fin rays v.11–12. Total
number of vertebrae 34–35, consisting of 18+16(1) or 19+16(1).

Head and eye large, mouth inferior, snout rounded, ventral surface bordered by a deep longitudinal groove
on each side. Rostral cap and upper lip fused, separated only by a narrow, shallow groove. Lower jaw covered
by a thick squarish 'cushion' that can be folded backwards. 'Cushion' composed of two adnate tissue layers: a
deeper layer, the lower lip, smooth, not continuous with upper lip around corner of mouth; and a superficial
layer, papillated, thick, continuous with skin of isthmus and connected with rostral cap by a narrow strip of
skin around corner of mouth, extended posteriorly and broadened as a flat, slightly papillated skin fold at pos-
terolateral most corner of mouth (Fig. 2a). Large pre-epiphysial and post-epiphysial fontanelle. Five infraor-
bital  bones  (IO1-5);  IO1-3  platelike;  IO4-5  reduced  in  width,  comprised  of  sensory  canal  only.  Gill
membranes joined to isthmus. Fifth ceratobranchial with 4 needle-like pharyngeal teeth, arranged in a single
row. Swimbladder coated by thick peritoneal tunic, posterior chamber greatly reduced. Anterior chamber par-
tially enclosed in a bony capsule formed anteriorly by lateral process of the 2nd vertebral centrum and laterally
by the outer arm of the os suspensorium. 

Paired fins horizontally placed. Pectoral fin almost reaching horizontal through dorsal-fin orgin. Pelvic-
fin  origin  posterior  to  dorsal-fin  origin,  insertion  opposite  3rd  branched  dorsal-fin  ray.  Anus  positioned

along lateral line, plus 1–2 on base of caudal fin. 3.5/1/2 transverse scale rows from dorsal-fin origin to pelvic-
fin origin, 10 around caudal peduncle. Scales absent from ventral surface between pectoral fins.

Coloration: In alcohol body background olive. Scales on flanks and dorsal surface edged with dark pig-
ment. Dark pigment between pores of lateral line, forming an indistinct lateral streak. Occiput and dorsal sur-
face of snout dark. Dorsal surface between occiput and dorsal-fin origin with one or two indistinct saddles.
Five prominent dark saddles along dorsal surface between dorsal-fin origin and caudal-fin base, first situated
at dorsal-fin origin, second between insertions of branched dorsal-fins rays 6–9, third between dorsal-fin and

anal-fin origin, fourth directly above anal fin and fifth situated anterior to caudal-fin base. Large dark blotch
on flank, situated posterodorsal to opercle opening, extending across lateral line scales 3–6. Unbranched pec-
toral-fin rays and base of dorsal-fin rays edged with dark pigment. Caudal fin with irregular dark patterning.
Peritoneal lining silvery, speckled with dark melanophores.

Distribution: Definitively known from headwaters of the Ataran basin in Myanmar (Fig. 3). See Kottelat

(2003, 2004) for a more detailed description of the basin. 

Etymology: From the Latin adjective robustus, meaning strong or robust, in allusion to the overall robust

appearance of this species.

Discussion

The genus Psilorhynchus was created by McClelland (1839) for the species described by Hamilton (1822) as
Cyprinus balitora and C. sucatio. Hora (1920) first revised the genus, though he did not have access to P.
sucatio. He later split Psilorhynchus (Hora, 1921a), creating the new genus Parapsilorhynchus for the species
P. tentaculatus, and redescribed P. sucatio based on fresh material (Hora, 1921b). Since Hora’s revision sev-
eral authors have further defined the genus (Mukerji, 1933; Jayaram, 1981; Rainboth, 1983; Yazdani et al.,
1990).

The new species, P. robustus, can be assigned to the genus Psilorhynchus (sensu Rainboth, 1983) based
on the following combination of characters: back arched, ventral surface flattened; mouth small and inferior;
barbels absent; gill-membranes joined broadly to isthmus with aperture extending ventrally to base of pectoral
fin; paired fins inserted horizontally; scales large, 32–34 in lateral line; dorsal fin with iii.9 rays, anal fin with
iii.6  rays,  pectoral  with  v.11–12  rays,  pelvic fin  with ii.7  rays; 5th  ceratobranchial  with 4  pharyngeal teeth,
arranged  in  a  single  row;  pre-epiphysial  fontanel  present;  posterior  swimbladder  chamber  greatly  reduced,
anterior chamber partially enclosed in a bony capsule formed anteriorly by the lateral process of the 2nd verte-
bral centrum and laterally by the outer arm of the os suspensorium (= 4th pleural rib of other authors).

Though  the  interrelationships  within  the  genus  Psilorhynchus  are  currently  unknown,  the  new  species
appears to be more closely related to those species of Psilorhynchus with a papillated skin fold at the postero-
lateral most corner of the mouth (Fig. 2), specifically P. balitora, P. gracilis and P. sucatio. Of these three spe-
cies, P. robustus is most similar in terms of meristics to P. balitora and P. gracilis (Table 2) as both have 9
branched dorsal-fin rays and 3 unbranched anal-fin rays (vs. 8 and 2, respectively). 

Based  on  examination  of  the  four  Indian  species  available  to  them  (P.  balitora,  P.  homaloptera,  P.
pseudecheneis, P. sucatio), Yazdani et al., (1990) divided the species of Psilorhynchus into two genera, Psilo-
rhynchus  sensu  stricto  and  Psilorhynchoides  for  the  inclusion  of  P.  homaloptera  (type  species)  and  P.
pseudecheneis. This decision was based on a number of differences that they observed between the external
appearance of P. homaloptera and P. pseudecheneis, and P. balitora and P. sucatio, and in the osteology of P.
homaloptera and P. balitora, including: body flattened anteriorly and compressed laterally towards posterior
half of the body in Psilorhynchoides (vs. body more or less spindle shaped with distinct convexity of the dor-
sal profile with peak at dorsal-fin origin in Psilorhynchus); broad based paired fins, well spread out horizon-
tally (vs. narrow based, not so much spread out horizontally); small eyes (vs. eyes fairly large); scales absent
on chest (vs. present); 8–10 unbranched pectoral-fin rays (vs. 4–6); lateral line scales numbering above 40 (vs.
32–33, as counted by Yazdani et al.); skull broad (vs. long and slender); supraethmoid fossa (= post-epiphys-
ial fontanelle) present in P. homaloptera (vs. absent in P. balitora); ethmoid-frontal fontanelle (= pre-epiphys-
ial fontanelle) long and slender in P. homaloptera (vs. short and broad in P. balitora); dorsal ribs of second
and fourth vertebrae forming a bony capsule enclosing the anterior swim bladder chamber in P. homaloptera
(vs. dorsal ribs of second and fourth vertebrae just folded with lateral openings); urohyal thick and catapult
shaped with forked anterior tips in P. homaloptera (vs. urohyal a more compact shaft-like structure with ante-
rior tips only a little forked in P. balitora); lateral foramen present on postero-lateral border of basipterygium
in P. homaloptera (vs. absent in P. balitora).

The placement of P. homaloptera and P. pseudecheneis within a separate genus appears to have been fol-
lowed only by Nelson (1994, 2006) and Nebeshwar et al. (2007), with other authors retaining them in Psilo-
rhynchus.  Though  characters  of  osteology  featured  prominently  in  Yazdani  et  al.’s  characterization  of
Psilorhynchoides, they only examined the osteology of a few specimens (number unknown) representing only
two  species,  one  for  each  genus  (P.  homaloptera  for  Psilorhynchoides  and  P.  balitora  for  Psilorhynchus).
Based on observations of a large number of cleared and stained specimens, representing 5 species (P. balitora,
P. gracilis, P. pseudecheneis, P. robustus, P. sucatio), encompassing a greater geographic range than material
examined by Yazdani et al. (Nepal, India, Bangladesh & Myanmar vs. India) it is clear that the characters used
to  define the  genus Psilorhynchoides  are not  restricted to P.  homaloptera and P.  pseudecheneis but  have a
mosaic distribution within Psilorhynchus (summarised in Table 3). Though it is true that P. homaloptera and
P. pseudecheneis exhibit a more elongate body and a higher number of unbranched pectoral-fin rays and lat-
eral line scales than all other species of Psilorhynchus (Tables 1–3), we prefer to retain these species within
Psilorhynchus pending the outcome of a forthcoming phylogenetic analysis (Conway, in prep.).

The earlier eastern extent of the range of Psilorhynchus was the Irrawaddy drainage. The discovery of the
genus in the Ataran drainage leaves a gap as there is no published record from the Salween drainage, located
between the previous two. The presence of Psilorhynchus is expected in the Salween, and indeed we have
information that suggests that the genus is present in its tributary Mae Nam Moei, but this awaits specimen-
based confirmation.
