Resumen.- Se revisan los caracteres que soportan la monofilia de la cohorte Clupeocephala -el clado más grande de
Teleostei-. La re-evaluación de estos caracteres demuestra que: 1) varios de ellos no son únicos, contradiciendo  inter-
pretaciones  previas,  sino  que  son  homoplasias  que  se  presentan  también  en  grupos  ajenos  a  clupeocéfalos  (e.g.,
†crossognátidos  y  osteoglosomorfos),  2)  otros  están  ausentes  en  clupeocéfalos  basales,  3)  algunos  son  variables  en
clupeocéfalos,  4)  otros  son,  aparentemente,  caracteres  errados  y  5)  algunos  de  esos  caracteres,  en  la  forma  en  que
fueron descritos, no son homólogos. El presente estudio muestra que la monofilia de Clupeocephala está soportada por
varios caracteres que no son ambiguos. Tres de ellos son aparentemente caracteres derivados únicos (osificación tem-
prana  del  autopalatino,  arteria  hioidea  perforando  el  hipohial  ventral,  placa  dentaria  del  último  faringobranquial  o
cartilaginoso faringobranquial 4 resultan del crecimiento de una placa y no de la fusión de varias de ellas) y siete son
homoplásticos pero son interpretados como adquiridos independientemente en cada uno de los linajes en que se presen-
tan  (e.g.,  presencia  de  anguloarticular,  retroarticular  excluído  de  la  faceta  articular  para  el  cuadrado,  ausencia  de
placas  dentarias  en  faringobranquial  1  y  presencia  de  seis  o  menos  hipurales).  Un  caracter  previamente  interpretado
como una sinapomorfía de clupeocéfalos es propuesto como una posible sinapomorfía de euteleósteos (arco neural del
centro ural 1 [terminología poliural] atrofiado o ausente). Además, los resultados obtenidos revelan la necesidad de más
estudios morfológicos, ontogenéticos y filogenéticos que incluyan numerosas especies de elopomorfos, osteoglosomorfos
y  clupeocéfalos,  tanto  primitivos  como  avanzados,  para  entender  el  significado  y  distribución  de  los  caracteres
homoplásticos y testar aquellos que se consideran como únicos en la evolución de ciertos grupos de teleósteos.

Palabras  clave:  Peces,  Teleostei,  monofilia,  sinapomorfias,  homoplasias

Abstract.- The characters supporting the monophyly of Clupeocephala are revised. The re-evaluation of these characters
demonstrates that: 1) several characters as previously interpreted, are not unique, but homoplastic occurring elsewhere
in non clupeocephalans (e.g., †crossognathiforms and osteoglossomorphs); 2) other characters are absent in most basal
clupeocephalans; 3) some are variably present in basal clupeocephalans; 4) other characters seem to be wrong; and 5)
several characters as previously defined, represent ambiguous homologies. Nevertheless, the present study reveals that
the monophyly of Clupeocephala is supported by several unambiguous characters. Three of them are, apparently, uniquely
derived  novelties  (early  ossification  of  autopalatine;  hyoidean  artery  piercing  ventral  hypohyal;  toothplate  of  last
pharyngobranchial  or  pharyngobranchial  cartilage  4  corresponds  to  growth  of  only  one  toothplate),  and  seven  are
homoplastic,  but  are  interpreted  here  as  independently  acquired  in  the  different  teleostean  subgroups  where  they
occur  (e.g.,  anguloarticular  present;  retroarticular  excluded  from  articular  facet  for  quadrate;  toothplates  on
pharyngobranchial 1 absent; six or fewer hypurals present). One character previously interpreted as a clupeocephalan
synapomorphy  (neural  arch  of  ural  centrum  1  [polyural  terminology]  reduced  or  lost)  is  proposed  as  a  euteleostean
synapomorphy. Additionally,  the  results  reveal  the  need  for  further  developmental,  morphological,  ontogenetic  and
phylogenetic  studies,  including  many  basal  and  advanced  elopomorph,  osteoglossomorph,  and  clupeocephalan  species,
to  understand  the  meaning  and  distribution  of  the  homoplastic  characters  and  to  test  those  interpreted  as  unique
novelties  of  teleostean  subgroups.

Key  words:  Fishes,  Teleostei,  monophyly,  synapomorphies,  homoplasies

INTRODUCTION
The teleostean cohort Clupeocephala is an extant fish group
erected  by  Patterson  &  Rosen  (1977)  to  contain  the
subcohorts Clupeomorpha (e.g., engraulids, clupeids) and
Euteleostei (e.g., catfishes, salmonids, galaxiids, atherinids,
percoids)  (Fig.  1).  The  current  interpretation  of  the

Clupeocephala,  however,  includes  the  subcohorts
Ostarioclupeomorpha (Arratia 1996a, 1997) or Otocephala
(Johnson  &  Patterson  1996)  (ostariophysans  plus
clupeomorphs; see Nelson 2006, p. 127) and Euteleostei
(Fig.  2).  This  new  hypothesis  that  includes  the

ostarioclupeomorphs as sister to the euteleosts is supported
by morphological (e.g., Johnson & Patterson 1996, Arratia
1997,  1999)  and  molecular  (e.g.,  Inoue  et  al.  2001)
evidence, but see Li et al. (2008; Fig. 3), where the cohort
Clupeocephala appears in an unresolved position along with
elopomorphs (non-monophyletic) and osteoglossomorphs.
The Clupeocephala is the largest group among Teleostei
because it includes most teleosts (Fig. 4) with the exception
of elopomorphs, osteoglossomorphs, and extinct (†) basal
teleosts belonging to groups such as the †Leptolepididae,
the  †Crossognathiformes  (previously  considered  a
clupeoceplahan  group  by  Taverne  1989,  but  recently
interpreted as a basal teleostean clade by Arratia 2008a),
and the †Ichthyodectiformes.

The  large  group  Clupeocephala  has  a  long
evolutionary history that can be traced back to the Upper
Jurassic of Europe -about 153 million years ago-  with
fossil taxa such as †Leptolepides, †Orthogonikleithrus,
and †Tischlingerichthys (Arratia 1997:  figs. 39, 40, 49,
50, 55, 56). However, Peng et al. (2006) recent molecular
studies proposed the varying ages of divergence of 307
million  years  (Paleozoic:  Carboniferous)  for  the
clupeocephalans  and  of  282  million  years  (Paleozoic:
Permian) for the ostarioclupeomorphs.

The name Clupeocephala was used first by Greenwood
(1973) for clupeomorphs only. The creation of the cohort
Clupeocephala was based on five characters (Patterson &
Rosen 1977: 126). Later, Taverne (1989) and Arratia (1997,
1999,  2008a)  modified,  added  and/or  deleted  a  few
characters. Arratia (1997, 1998) discussed these characters
and  demonstrated  that  some  of  them  are  not  unique  to
Clupeocephala  or  represent  incorrect  observations  (see
"Analysis of characters"). An additional problem is that the
inclusion of certain fossils -e.g., †crossognathiforms-and
new information on extant fishes change the interpretation
of a few characters previously thought to be as uniquely
derived clupeocephalan synapomorphies (Arratia 2008a, see
below).  The  main  problem  involving  several  of  these
characters is that they are based on conflicting or assumed
homologies where a common ancestry has been assumed
or they represent a homology hypothesis that is unsupported
by a phylogeny (see comments in Arratia 1998, 2004), an
issue  that  is  not  unique  to  clupeocephalans,  but  a
shortcoming  of  many  characters  supporting  different
phylogenetic levels of actinopterygians (see comments in
Schultze & Arratia 1989, Arratia & Schultze 1991, 1992,
Arratia 1996b, 1999, 2004, 2008b, Cloutier & Arratia 2004,
Schultze 2008, Wiley 2008).

Clupeocephala  re-visited: Analysis  of  characters

Within  the  frame  of  the  Tree  of  Life  project
"Collaborative Research: Systematics of Cypriniformes,
Earth’s Most Diverse Clade of Freshwater Fishes", I have
had the opportunity to study day-to-day ontogenetic series
of cypriniforms, other ostariophysans, clupeomorphs and
basal euteleosts and discovered that some characters that
are currently interpreted as clupeocephalan synapomorphies
are not present in some of the basal clupeocephalans or
have  conflicting  interpretations.  The  main  goal  of  this
contribution is to re-evaluate the clupeocephalan characters
in  light  of  new  data  and  to  propose  an  emended
characterization of the group. To fulfill this goal, the study
is  focused  at  the  basal  clupeocephalan  level  (e.g.,
Clupeomorpha,  Ostariophysi,  Protacanthopterygii)  and
includes evidence of both fossil and extant fish groups. It
is accepted here that some of the clupeocephalan characters
may have been lost in more advanced forms.

MATERIAL  AND  METHODS
Most of the extant fishes included in this study are cleared
and stained (cl&st) for both cartilage and bone following a
procedure described in Arratia & Schultze (1992). Others
are prepared as dry skeletons (skl). Some of the fossil (†)

acid  prepared  according  to  the  technique  described  in
Toombs & Rixon (1959). Most of the studied material has
been  prepared  by  the  author. The  ontogenetic  series  of
Cycleptus elongatus was cleared and stained [by J. Engeman
(University of South Dakota, Vermillion)]. Small specimens
were  studied  and  photographed  under  an  Olympus®
microscope with normal optic, face contrast and polarized
light with a Nikon® camera attachment. Larger specimens
were studied under a Leica® MZ9 stereomicroscope with
both a Leica digital camera attachment and camera lucida
attachment. The size of the specimens is given only for the
extant  material  (SL:  standard  length;  NL:  notochordal
length)

ANALYSIS OF CHARACTERS

The morphological characters are presented according to
body  regions. A  short  introduction  of  each  character  is
presented first. A description and analysis of the character

follows, ending in a new interpretation and evaluation where
necessary.

PALATOQUADRATE

"Autopalatine bone ossifies early in ontogeny" (Arratia &
Schultze 1991, Arratia 1999, 2008a).

As far as it is known, the autopalatine bone begins to
ossify  in  the  pars  autopalatina  of  the  palatoquadrate
cartilage early in ontogeny in all clupeocephalans where
the early development of bones is known. For instance, in
the gonorynchiform Chanos chanos the bone appears as a
thin perichondral ossification at about 15.5 mm SL and from
that moment on it ossifies very quickly (Fig. 5A; Arratia
1992: fig. 4B; Arratia & Bagarinao 2009, p. 88, fig. 3). In
the cyprinid, Danio rerio, the autopalatine begins to ossify
at  7.6  mm  SL  (Cubbage  &  Mabee  1996).  In  another
cyprinid, Barbus barbus, the autopalatine begins to ossify
at about 14 mm SL (Vandewalle et al. 1992). The bone is
ossified  at  25  mm  SL  in  the  cyprinid  Opsariichthys
uncirostris  (KUMNH  21448).  In  the  catostomid
Catostomus commersoni the autopalatine begins to ossify
at 15.9 mm SL and the ossification invades the cartilage
and also spreads away from the cartilage around its anterior
end at 19.6 mm SL (Engenman et al. 2009). In another
catostomid, Cycleptus elongatus, the ossification of the
autopalatine begins earlier and in specimens around 15 mm
SL the bone is almost completely ossified at its middle
region (TU 200816; Fig. 5B). In the siluriform Diplomystes
camposensis, the autopalatine is partially ossified at 23 mm
SL; it is almost completely ossified at 28 mm SL (Arratia
1992: fig. 16A-C). In Ictalurus punctatus the autopalatine
begins to ossify at 11.7 mm SL, and in specimens of 14-
14.5 mm SL the bone is almost totally ossified (Arratia 1991,
p. 50-51). In Noturus exilis the autopalatine is ossified in
specimens of 13.6 mm SL (Arratia 1992, p. 51, fig. 32A).
In the perciform Sparus aurata the autopalatine begins to
ossify at 7.4 mm SL (Faustino & Power 2001). Similar
observations  have  been  obtained  from  a  variety  of
clupeocephalans, such as the esociform Esox (Jollie 1984),
the  salmonid  Oncorhynchus  mykiss,  the  clupeomorphs
Coilia nasus  and  Dorosoma cepedianum  (Fig.  5C),  the
perciforms Percichthys and Percilia (pers. obser.), Dentex
dentex (Koumoundouros et al. 2000), and Lates calcifer
(Kohno et al. 1996). In contrast, the autopalatine begins to
ossify late in ontogeny (juveniles / subadults) (Fig. 5D-F)
in more basal fishes where the development is known, e.g.,
Amia calva (Arratia & Schultze 1991, Grande & Bemis
1998).  Even  in  large  specimens  the  bone  is  mainly  a
chondroid element or a hard fibrocartilage. The autopalatine

is represented mainly by cartilage and begins to ossify in
specimens of about 90 mm SL in Elops (Arratia & Schultze
1991:  23-24;  Fig.  5E,  F  herein).  In  large  specimens  of
elopiforms (e.g., Elops saurus, Megalops cyprinoides) and
albuliforms  (e.g.,  Albula  vulpes),  the  autopalatine  is
composed of a thin superficial ossification surrounding a
mass of cartilage and chondroid bone in different stages of
ossification.  Osteoglossomorphs  lack  an  autopalatine
ossification (e.g., Taverne 1977, Arratia & Schultze 1991,
Hilton  2002),  with  a  few  exceptions  such  as  Heterotis
niloticus  and  Scleropages  leichardti  (other  species  of
Scleropages lack an autopalatine; Ridewood 1905, Taverne
1998).

This  character  is  poorly  known  for  fossils  due  to
preservation  conditions  (e.g.,  lack  of  preservation  of
cartilage or other soft tissues, or the palatine region may be
covered by lateral bones such as maxilla, antorbital, and
first  infraorbital  bone). Although,  early  developmental
stages of fossil clupeocephalans are available (e.g., many
young  specimens  of  the  euteleosts  †Leptolepides  and
†Orthogonikleithrus deposited in JME), they are poorly
known.

 The late ossification of the autopalatine (as in Amia and
elopiforms)  has  been  confirmed  for  certain  non-
clupeocephalan fossils (see Arratia & Tischlinger 2010:
character 35). Although this character is represented by
many question marks in the coding of the fossil forms, the
parsimony analysis interprets this character state as present
in the fossil clupeocephalans included in the phylogenetic
analysis.

Thus, the early ossification of the autopalatine versus its
late ossification (in basal forms) is, according to the available
information, a unique character of clupeocephalans.

LOWER JAW

The evolution of the teleostean lower jaw involves some
major  changes  of  evolutionary  importance  that  are
interpreted  as  synapormorphies  at  different  levels  of
Teleostei. For instance, loss of coronoid and surangular
bones are synapomorphies of the crown-group Teleostei or
Teleocephala (De Pinna 1996). When fossils are included,
the loss of coronoid bones stands as a synapomorphy of
†Pholidophorus bechei plus more advanced teleosts, and
the loss of the surangular is interpreted as a synapomorphy
of †Leptolepis coryphaenoides plus more advanced teleosts
(Arratia 1999). The lateral position of the posterior opening
of the mandibular canal in the angular is a synapomorphy
shared by osteoglossomorphs plus clupeocephalans (Arratia

1999),  whereas  the  medial  or  posterior  position  of  the
posterior opening is present in more basal teleosts. Cavin
(2001) stated that in the elopomorph  Albula vulpes the
posterior opening of the mandibular canal is placed laterally
in the posterior part of the jaw. My observations based on
cleared and stained specimens and dry skeletons do not
support Cavin’s claim, because the opening has a posterior
position  in  the  angular.  However,  if  this  character  was
present  in  Albula,  it  would  not  be  invalidated  as  a
synapomorphy of osteoglossomorphs plus clupeocephalans,
because the position of the medial and/or posterior opening
in fossil and recent elopiforms represents the primitive
condition; albuliforms are not the most basal elopomorphs.
In addition, the taxon sampling used by Cavin (2001) does
not permit the variation of the character to be analyzed (e.g.,
the  osteoglossomorphs  are  absent  in  his  phylogenetic
analysis and the elopomorphs are not monophyletic in his
analysis: Albula, †Paraelops and clupeocephalans have an
unresolved position).

In general, the modern teleostean lower jaw includes
four main bones: the dermal dentary anteriorly, and the
dermal  angular,  chondral  articular,  and  retroarticular
forming the posterior region of the jaw. In amiiforms, some
of the stem-group teleosts, and certain "pholidophoriforms",
another dermal bone -the surangular- is the other main
element forming the posterior part of the jaw (Fig. 6).

The bones of the posterior part of the lower jaw (the
angular,  articular,  and  retroarticular)  of  teleosts  show
various  patterns  of  fusion  (Nelson  1973a,  1973b).
According to Nelson (1973a), the angular fuses either with
the articular or with the retroarticular in almost all teleosts,

in  many  teleosts  all  three  bones  are  fused,  and  in
osteoglossomorphs three patterns are found. Nelson (1973a)
also posited that the different fusion patterns have developed
at least twice in the evolution of teleosts.

The presence of "angular and articular bones fused, and
the retroarticular excluded from the articular surface for
the quadrate" is one of the characters supporting the cohort
Clupeocephala (Patterson & Rosen 1977). The character
as defined is complex, because on one hand it concerns the
relationships  (fusion  versus  non  fusion)  of  the  bones
forming the posterior region of the lower jaw, and on the
other hand it concerns the presence versus absence of the
retroarticular bone in the articular facet of the quadrate.
Consequently, most authors treat it as two independent
characters: 1) "Angular and articular bones are fused". (2)
"The retroarticular is excluded from the articular surface
for the quadrate".

1) [In adult individuals …] "Angular and articular bones

are fused".

The  dermal  angular  and  the  chondral  articular  and
retroarticular bones develop from three independent centers
of  ossification  that  appear  at  different  times  in  early
ontogeny of extant teleosts. Commonly, the first bone to
begin to ossify is the angular at the postero-lateral side of
the jaw, followed simultaneously or slightly later by the
retroarticular ossification at the ventro-posterior corner of
Meckel’s  cartilage.  Later,  the  articular  develops  as  an
ossification of Meckel’s cartilage, medial to the angular.
During growth, both dermal and chondral ossifications fuse.
For examples, see the description of the early ontogeny of

the posterior part of the jaw of Esox by Jollie (1984: 76-77)
and of Chanos Arratia & Bagarinao (2009: 88, figs. 3.4,
3.5). Unfortunately, some authors described, erroneously,
the anguloarticular arising from one center of ossification
that begins to ossify slightly after the retroarticular (e.g.,
Langille & Hall [1987] for Oryzias; Cubbage & Mabee
[1996] for Danio; Engenman et al. [2008] for Catostomus).
The angular and articular bones (Fig. 7A, B) become
fused through growth in clupeocephalans. However, these
ossifications may be distinct even in large specimens, and
it may take some time before a line of suture between the
borders  of  the  chondral  ossification  (articular)  and  the
dermal  angular  disappears  completely  (Fig.  8A,  B).  In
contrast, in more basal forms two patterns are observed: (i)
Angular and articular bones are independent throughout
the life of the individual (e.g., Amia calva, the elopomorph
Albula, and the osteoglossomorphs Hiodon and Heterotis.
(ii) Angular, articular, and retroarticular are fused. This
condition is observed in the Early Jurassic †Pholidophorus
bechei  and  in  the  "true"  basal  teleost  †Leptolepis
coryphaenoides. In the extant elopomorph Megalops, the
angular, articular and retroarticular bones become fused
during growth, so in large individuals only one ossification
(Fig. 9) is observed at the posterior corner of the jaw. There
is a fusion between the angular and retroarticular in Elops,
and during growth the fusion also includes the articular
(Arratia 1987: text-fig. 25A-F, 1997: fig. 85A). This is

the condition in †Ph. bechei, †Leptolepis coryphaenoides,
and in †Siemensichthys siemensi (Arratia 2000a: fig. 15E,
F).  The  three  bones  are  also  fused  in  the  extant
osteoglossomorphs  Petrocephalus  and  Gnathonemus
(Hilton  2003),  and  also  in  siluriforms  among
ostarioclupeomorphs  (e.g.,  Diplomystes, Arratia  2003:
fig. 1.10).

The presence of a fused angular and articular is accepted
as a synapomorphy of the Clupeocephala. However, this is
a homoplastic character among teleosts because the fusion
between the angular and articular (Fig. 10) is also present
in  numerous  osteoglossomorphs  more  advanced  than
Hiodon,  such  as  Chitala,  Osteoglossum,  Pantodon,
Papyrocromus, and Xenostomus (e.g., Taverne 1977, Hilton
2003, pers. obser.). The fusion is also present in fossil basal
teleosts such as the †crossognathiforms †Crossognathus
saudianus (Taverne 1989: fig. 5), †Rhacolepis buccalis
(Forey 1977: fig. 11C), and †Goulmimichthys arambourgi
(Cavin 2001). Among members of the †Varasichthyidae,
†Varasichthys ariasi has an anguloarticular bone (Arratia
1981: text-fig. 8), but the condition in †Protoclupea and
†Domeykos is unclear. Distinct ossifications of both bones
are visible, but it remains unknown whether or not they are
fused  at  their  confluent  medial  surfaces.  In  contrast  to
†Varasichthys, a retroarticular bone has not been observed
in any specimen of †Protoclupea or †Domeykos, nor an
articulatory region for it. Therefore, Arratia & Schultze

(1985:  text-figs.  5,  10,  15B)  interpreted  the  jaws  of
†Protoclupea and †Domeykos as lacking a retroarticular.
However, comparing the jaws of the fossils with those in
extant  Megalops  and 
the  extinct  †Leptolepis
coryphaenoides,  another  possibility  is  that  the  angular,
articular and retroarticular are fused in †Protoclupea and
†Domeykos.

According to the present evidence (Fig. 10), and the
results of the parsimony analysis, I interpret the presence
of a fused anguloarticular in †crossognathiforms, numerous
osteoglossomorphs more advanced than hiodontids, and
clupeocephalans as independently acquired in these groups.
Cavin (2001), cited in Cavin & Grigorescu (2005), reached
a similar conclusion for the presence of an anguloarticular
in the †Crossognathidae.

2) [In adult individuals …]  "Retroarticular excluded

from the articular facet for the quadrate".

The main bone forming the facet for articulation with
the quadrate is usually the articular; however, the lateral
margin may include a small contribution of the angular and,
in some fishes, the retroarticular may be part of the facet at
the  medial  side  of  the  jaw.  The  retroarticular  bone  is
included in the articular facet for the quadrate in teleosts
such as elopomorphs and osteoglossomorphs among the
crown group Teleostei. In contrast, the bone is restricted to

ostarioclupeomorphs (Fig. 8A, B) and euteleosts (Fig. 7A,
B).  In  the  gonorynchiform  Chanos,  however,  the
retroarticular that is not included in the articular facet for
the quadrate in young and juvenile specimens (Fig. 11A)
becomes part of the facet (Fig. 11B) during growth. The
retroarticular is tidily sutured with the anguloarticular in
specimens over 330 mm SL.

The  presence  of  a  retroarticular  excluded  from  the
articular  facet  for  the  quadrate  is  interpreted  as  a
synapomorphy of the Clupeocephala. However, this is a
homoplastic character because the retroarticular is included
in the articular facet for the quadrate in the clupeocephalan
Chanos. Certain osteoglossomorphs such as Osteoglossum

and Scleropages (Taverne 1977, Hilton 2003) also have the
retroarticular excluded from the facet for the quadrate. In
other non-clupeocephalans, such as the †crossognathiforms
†Crossognathus  saudianus  (Taverne  1989:  fig.  5),
†Rhacolepis  buccalis  (Forey  1977:  fig.  11C),  and
†Varasichthys  ariasi  (Arratia  1981:  text-fig.  8)  the
retroarticular is also excluded from the articular facet for
the quadrate. Among †ichthyodectiforms, a retroarticular
included  in  the  facet  for  the  quadrate  is  observed  in
†Allothrissops and †Cladocyclus (Patterson & Rosen 1977:
fig. 8A-C), but the bone is excluded from the articular facet
in several genera such as †Ichthyodectes, †Xiphactinus,
†Gillicus,  †Saurodon  (e.g.,  Nelson  1973a),  and
†Prosaurodon (Stewart 1999).

According to the current evidence and the results of the
parsimony analyses (e.g., Arratia 1999, 2008a, Arratia &
Tischlinger  2010),  the  presence  of  the  retroarticular
excluded  from  the  articular  facet  for  the  quadrate  is  a
homoplastic character for teleosts. Nevertheless, because
of its distribution, I interpret the presence of this character
in †crossognathiforms, †ichthyodectiforms more advanced
than  †Allothrissops,  some  osteoglossomorphs  more
advanced than the hiodontids, and clupeocephalans as a
character  independently  acquired  in  these  groups.  The
presence of the retroarticular as part of the articulatory facet
for  quadrate  in  large  specimens  of  Chanos  opens  the
question about whether this is an autapomorphy of Chanos
or if we are missing information about late development of
other gonorynchiforms and clupeocephalans that may show
a condition similar to that in Chanos.

HYOID ARCH

"Hyoidean artery piercing ventral hypohyal"  (Arratia 1999)
versus hyoidean artery piercing one or both dorsal and
ventral hypohyals or not piercing the hypohyal(s) (Arratia
& Schultze 1990, De Pinna 1996).

This  character  stands  as  a  clupeocephalan  synapo-
morphy  present  among  others  in  clupeomorphs,
ostariophysans and protacanthopterygians. To the best of
my  knowledge,  this  character  is  unknown  in  fossil
clupeocephalans and in more advanced euteleosts where
the trajectory of blood vessels is unknown or poorly known.

BRANCHIAL ARCHES

The diversity of the branchial arch elements among teleosts
and their phylogenetic importance was first reported by
Nelson (1969). During the last 30 years, the branchial arches
have been a source of characters for numerous papers, which
provide a variety of synapomorphies that identify groups
within the clupeocephalans, such as the ostariophysans
(Fink & Fink 1981, 1996), cypriniforms (Siebert 1987),
salmoniforms (Rosen 1974), lower euteleosts (Johnson &
Patterson 1996), and higher euteleosts (Rosen 1973).

Most clupeocephalan branchial characters, like those of
the caudal skeleton (see below), are problematic because
of uncertain homologies. Additionally, the information is
available mainly for the extant forms.

The  following  characters  have  been  proposed  as

clupeocephalan synapomorphies:

1)  "Tooth plates primitively fused with the first three
pharyngobranchials  and  fifth  ceratobranchial"  is  a
complex  character  proposed  as  a  clupeocephalan
synapomorphy by Patterson & Rosen (1977). Later, the
character  was  modified  by  Lauder  &  Liem  (1983)  as
"Toothplates fused with endoskeletal gill arch elements".
In contrast, for Arratia (1999) the character was "Tooth
plates not associated with pharyngobranchials 1-3".

This character, independent of the three different versions
presented above, faces two problems: (i) erroneous use of
anatomical terms, and (ii) the three pharyngobranchials are
considered jointly, so that the definition of the character
implies that toothplates are consistently associated with all
pharyngobranchials 1-3.

Toothplates fused to the first three pharyngobranchials
was interpreted as a character of basal clupeocephalans by
Patterson & Rosen (1977). However, my survey of this
character in basal and advanced clupeocephalans reveals
that  the  toothplates  are  never  fused  with  the
pharyngobranchial bones, but that when they are present
they  overlay  the  bones  (e.g.,  Coilia,  Esox,  Umbra).
Furthermore, most basal euteleosts do not have toothplates
associated with pharyngobranchials 1-3. Consequently, this

Clupeocephala  re-visited: Analysis  of  characters

character -which is based on incorrect observations- does
not stand up for the Clupeocephala.

According to Arratia (1999), "absence of tooth plates
associated  with  pharyngobranchials  1-3" 
is  a
synapomorphy for basal clupeocephalans.  Although this
character  is  based  on  accurate  observations,  it  faces  a
problem of homology. The three pharyngobranchials are
considered together, but the condition may vary among
pharyngobranchials. For instance, no toothplates overly
pharyngobranchials  1-3  in  most  basal  clupeomorphs;
however, the clupeomorphs Coilia and Jenkinsia and  the
esocoid  Esox  have  toothplates  associated  with
pharyngobranchials 2-3, but the first pharyngobranchial
does not bear a toothplate. Thus, to postulate hypotheses
of homology, each pharyngobranchial should be treated
independently. Consequently, I separate the character into
three different ones with the following results:

i) Toothplate(s) are absent from pharyngobranchial 1
in lower clupeocephalans, so that this character appears to
be  a  synapomorphy  supporting  the  Clupeocephala
(however, toothplates are also absent in the basal extant
osteoglossomorph Hiodon and in Heterotis).

ii) Toothplates are absent from pharyngobranchial 2
in most basal clupeocephalans, e.g., clupeomorphs (pers.
obser.),  gonorynchiforms,  cypriniforms,  siluriforms,
gymnotiforms (Fink & Fink 1996, Arratia pers. obser.), and
salmoniforms (pers. obser.). They are also absent in the
osteoglossomorph Heterotis. However, they are present in
some clupeomorphs (e.g., Coilia and Jenkinsia) and some
euteleosts (e.g., Esox) among clupeocephalans.

iii) Toothplates are absent from pharyngobranchial 3
in most basal clupeocephalans, e.g., clupeomorphs (pers.
obser.),  gonorynchiforms,  cypriniforms,  siluriforms,
gymnotiforms (Fink & Fink 1996, Arratia pers. obser.), and
salmoniforms (pers. obser.). They are also absent in the
osteoglossomorph Heterotis. However, they are present in
some  clupeomorphs  (e.g.,  Coilia,  Jenkinsia)  and  some
euteleots (e.g., Esox) among clupeocephalans.

Toothplate(s) fused to ceratobranchial 5 is a condition
found in clupeocephalans according to Patterson & Rosen
(1977).  However,  a  toothplate  ankylosed  or  fused  to
ceratobranchial 5 is a generalized condition among teleosts
including  elopomorphs,  osteoglossomorphs,  and
clupeocephalans.

 2) "Basibranchials 1-3 and basihyal cartilage are not
overlain by median tooth plates" (Arratia 1999: 325) versus
basibranchials and basihyal cartilages overlain by medial
toothplates (Lauder & Liem 1983 based on Rosen 1982).

The basibranchials 1-3 and basihyal (Fig. 12) are not
overlain  by  median  toothplates  in  ostarioclupeomorphs
among clupeocephalans, but toothplates associated with all
these elements (e.g., Esox; Rosen 1974: fig. 1A; pers. obser.)
or with one or another are variable present in euteleosts.
The parsimony analysis interprets the absence of toothplates
from  basibranchials  1-3  and  basihyal  cartilage  as  a
clupeocephalan  synapomorphy,  but  to  understand  this
character properly, I believe that it should be separated into
several characters dealing with the presence or absence of
toothplates associated with each branchial element, e.g.,
basihyal, basibranchial 1, basibranchial 2, and basibranchial
3, so that the homologies involved can be understood. I
will deal with a detailed description of these characters
elsewhere.

3) "Tooth plate of last pharyngobranchial bone/cartilage

formed by growth of one tooth plate" (Arratia 1999).

Pharyngobranchial 4 (or infrapharyngobranchial 4) does
not  ossify  in  teleosts,  so  the  fourth  pharyngo-branchial
element is a cartilage that may bear several toothplates of
different sizes and shapes or only one toothplate (see Arratia
1999: figs. 9, 10).

In extant clupeocephalans (including the basal lineages),
the  toothplate  associated  with  the  cartilaginous
pharyngobranchial  4  results  in  the  growth  of  only  one
toothplate, which is present from early ontogeny on. In some
clupeocephalans, e.g., gonorynchiforms, no toothplates are
associated with pharyngobranchial 4 or any other branchial
element. In contrast, several toothplates are associated with
pharyngobranchial  4  in  elopiforms  (e.g.,  Elops  and
Megalops) and basal osteoglossomorphs (e.g., Hiodon).

CAUDAL  SKELETON

The caudal skeleton, along with the cranium, is one of the
most important sources of characters used in phylogenetic
studies of teleosts (Arratia 2008b, 2009). The clarity and
use of many of the characters from the caudal skeleton suffer
from differences in homology assessments between studies
regarding the formation of the centra involved in the caudal
fin (preural and ural centra) to the origin and homology of
elements  such  as  the  epurals,  uroneurals  and  hypurals
(Schultze & Arratia 1989, Arratia & Schultze 1992, Arratia
2008b).

To  understand  the  homologization  of  the  caudal

elements, two main conditions are required:

i.

Interpretation  of  the  ural  region  in  the  polyural
fashion,  i.e.,  a  one-to-one  relationship  between  a  ural
centrum and its epaxial and hypaxial elements (Nybelin

1977,  Schultze  & Arratia  1989).  Only  in  this  way  it  is
possible  to  understand  the  relationships  between  each
centrum  and  its  epaxial  (e.g.,  epurals,  uroneurals)  and
hypaxial elements (hypurals) that are usually lost as a result
of  the  upturning  of  the  posteriormost  centra  and  the
subsequent displacement of bones.

ii. Study of the origin and development of the preural
and ural centra in day-to-day ontogenetic series so that the
relationships between the early caudal elements, the loss
of some of them, or the fusion of others can be properly
understood.

The  following  caudal  skeletal  characters  have  been

proposed as clupeocephalan synapomorphies:

"Neural arch over ural centrum 1 reduced or absent,
anteriorly directed membranous outgrowths developed from
the anterodorsal margin of the first uroneural" (Patterson
& Rosen 1977). Taverne (1989) separated this complex
character into two independent ones that he defined as (i)
"neural arch of ural centrum 1 reduced, fused with neural
arch of preural centrum 1 or lost", and (ii) "enlargement
more or less significant of the uroneurals with irregular
bony  expansions  of  the  ventro-basal  side  of  the  first
uroneural".  Each  of  these  characters  however,  requires
further analysis, as there is variation in the structure of each
among clupeocephalan taxa.

1) "Neural arch of ural centrum 1 reduced or lost".
The ural centrum 1 in the definition by Patterson &
Rosen (1977) corresponds to the first independent centrum
placed  posterior  to  preural  centrum  1  of  the  diural
terminology (Nybelin 1977). This centrum may correspond
to  only  ural  centrum  1,  or  only  ural  centrum  2  or  ural
centrum 1+2 of the polyural terminology. The neural arch
in question could be the neural arch of different centra.
Consequently, as previously defined this character is not
homologous among clupeocephalans.

If we assume -based on topological arguments- that the
atrophied or absent neural arch that is found posterior to
preural centrum 1 correspond to ural centrum 1, then this
character is also present outside the clupeocephalans. For
instance, it is present in adult Elops (Schultze & Arratia
1988: figs. 15, 17A, 22) with a small, ossified ural neural
arch 1. It is variably present in adult Hiodon (e.g., Schultze
& Arratia 1988: fig. 7), as well as in †ichthyodectiforms
such as †Allothrissops (Patterson & Rosen 1977: figs. 17,
18A, B) and †Eudiobectes (Patterson & Rosen 1977: fig.
20). As far the preservation permits, a reduced ural neural
arch 1 has been observed in †crossognathiforms such as
†Crossognathus and †Domeykos (Arratia 2008a: fig. 4A,
B), among others.

Among extant clupeocephalans, it is assumed that ural
neural  arch  1  is  absent  in  those  fishes  possessing  a
compound  centrum  and  a  pleurostyle  (=  supposedly,
modified uroneural 1), such as the ostariophysans. However,
the study of early ontogenetic stages shows that the ural
neural arches of one or more ural centra become included
in  the  fusion  during  growth  as  for  example  in  the
gonorynchiform Chanos (Fig. 13A, B) and cypriniforms
such as catostomids and cyprinids. Thus, the only arch and
spine present in adults is the result of the ontogenetic fusion
of the neural arch of preural centrum 1 and that of ural
centrum 1, at least. In clupeids the neural arch and spine
observed in adults corresponds to the neural arch and spine

of ural centrum 1 (Fig. 13C, D). The neural arch of preural
centrum 1 (Fig. 13C, D) is atrophied and becomes enclosed
by  the  autocentrum  during  growth.  In  other  extant
clupeocephalans, ural neural arch 1 may be very small or
even represented only by a small cartilage (e.g., Thymallus,
Arratia & Schultze: fig. 22A; Fig. 14A herein) or absent
(e.g., Oncorhynchus, Arratia & Schultze: figs. 3, 13, 14;
Fujita 1990; Fig. 14B herein). The character is variable
among the oldest fossil clupeocephalans. The Late Jurassic
†Leptolepides sprattiformis (Fig. 15C) and †L. haerteisi
have a short neural spine, and consequently a complete ural
neural arch 1 (Arratia, 1997: figs. 44, 48), whereas the
character is intraspecifically variable in the Late Jurassic

†Orthogoniklethrus leichi and †O. hoelli, with a short ural
neural spine 1 (Arratia 1997: fig. 61A) in a few specimens,
and a lack of spine and presence of an atrophic ural neural
arch 1 in most specimens (Arratia 1997: figs. 53, 60, 61B,
C).

Consequently,  as  new  ontogenetic  information
demonstrates, the neural arch and spine present in extant
ostarioclupeomorphs are not the neural arch and spine of
preural centrum 1, but may be the result of the fusion of the
neural arches of preural centrum 1 and ural centrum 1 or
the  arch  of  ural  centrum  1  alone.  My  survey  of  basal
euteleosts to date shows that a reduced or absent neural
arch of ural centrum 1 is a feature consistently present in
euteleosts.

2)  "Neural  spine  of  ural  centra  1  and  2  (polyural
terminology)" or "ural centrum 1 absent" versus presence
of neural spine. This character was proposed by Arratia
(1999)  to  test  the  position  of  †Leptolepides  and
†Orthogonikleithrus (bearing a neural spine on ural centrum
1; Fig. 15C) as basal clupeocephalans.

However,  as  new information  on  early  development
shows a neural spine of ural centrum 1 is present in extant
clupeids and engraulids (Fig. 13C, D) and the spine found
in ostariophysans may correspond to the ontogenetic fusion
of the neural spines of preural centrum 1 and ural centrum
1 (Fig. 13A, B). To the best of my knowledge, the absence

of  the  ural  neural  spine  1  (Figs.  15D,  14A,  B)  occurs
consistently in extant euteleosts among clupeocephalans
(see  illustrations  in  Fujita  1990)  because  their  arch  is
reduced  or  absent  (see  above). According  to  the  new
information  this  character  could  be  a  euteleostean
synapomorphy instead of a clupeocephalan synapo-morphy.
3)  "Anteriorly  directed  membranous  outgrowths
developed  from  the  anterodorsal  margin  of  the  first
uroneural" (Patterson & Rosen 1977) or "enlargement more
or less significant of the uroneurals with irregular bony
expansions of the ventro-basal side of the first uroneural"
(Taverne 1989).

This character refers to the first uroneural based on the
assumption that the first uroneural in all teleosts develops
as a modification of the same ural neural arch. If we assume
that  the  first  uroneural  in  basal  clupeocephalans  is
homologous  among  groups,  then  we  conclude  that  the
anteriorly directed membranous outgrowths are missing in
many extant engrauloids (see for instance Fujita 1990: figs.
17, 18, 26, 27, 28), and in most ostariophysans (see for
instance Fujita 1990: figs. 32-51). Membranous outgrows
developed from the anterodorsal margin of the so-called
first uroneral are present in basal euteleosts such as the
Late Jurassic genera †Leptolepides and †Orthogonikleithrus
and the Cretaceous genera †Erichalcis, †Manchurichthys
and †Humbertia (see Arratia & Schultze 1992: fig. 27A-

Clupeocephala  re-visited: Analysis  of  characters

D). In salmonids, where the origin and development of the
so-called first uroneural (= stegural) has been investigated
(Arratia  &  Schultze  1992),  the  first  uroneural  or
anteriormost uroneural develops as a modification of the
ural  neural  arch  of  ural  centrum  4  of  the  polyural
terminology. Thus, the expanded membranous ourgrowth
found in salmonids does not belong to uroneural 1, but to
uroneural 4 of the polyural terminology.

Studies based on early ongenetic stages are mandatory
if we want to understand whether the so-called uroneural 1
develops from the same ural neural arch among different
teleostean subgroups, in other words, if the uroneural 1 is
homologous among teleosts (Schultze & Arratia 1989). As
the  stegural,  the  pleurostyle  of  ostarioclupeomorphs  is
commonly interpreted as a modified uroneural 1; however,
it is unknown if the pleurostyle develops as a modification
of the neural arch of ural centrum 1 (polyural terminology)
or if develops from the same ural neural arch (other than
ural neural arch 1) in all ostariophysans and clupeomorphs.
To the best of my knowledge, and independently of the
ambiguous homology, the character discussed in this section
has  not  been  considered  by  most  authors  dealing  with
clupeocephalan or teleostean phylogenetic analyses.

In the following section, I analize other two potential
characters mentioned in the literature: "All uroneurals are
not  inclined  toward  the  horizontal",  but  are  aligned  in
different angles (Arratia 1999, 2008a), and "six hypurals
present" (Patterson & Rosen 1977). This section ends with
comments on a problematic character ("Stegural present").
4)  "All  uroneurals  are  not  inclined  toward  the
horizontal", but are aligned in different angles, in contrast
to  the  situation  present  in  basal  teleosts  (Arratia  1999,
2008a).

In basal teleosts the uroneurals are aligned at similar
angles  (Fig.  15A,  B).  This  condition  can  be  found  in
†Leptolepis coryphaenoides (e.g., Arratia 1991: fig. 7),
†ichthyodectiforms (e.g., Patterson & Rosen 1977: figs. 14,
17-21, Arratia 1997: figs. 24-25), extant teleosts such as
the basal elopiforms Elops and Megalops (e.g., Schultze &
Arratia 1988: figs. 7, 17A), and the basal osteoglossomorph
Hiodon (e.g., Schultze & Arratia 1988:  figs.  7,  11A-D,
Hilton  2002:  figs.  74,  76A-F).  In  contrast,  in  basal
clupeocephalans,  the  last  uroneurals  (Fig.  15C,  D)  are
aligned at a different angle with respect to the anterior series
of uroneurals. The alignment of the uroneurals at different
angles is a character shared by fossil (e.g., †Leptolepides,
Patterson & Rosen 1977: fig.  50, Arratia 1997: figs. 44,
48; †Orthogonikleithrus, Arratia 1997: figs. 61A, B) and

extant clupeocephalans (e.g., Fujita 1990: figs. 16, 17, 20,
23, 25, 29, 35, 38, 44, 62, and many others). However, it is
unclear  whether  the  last  uroneurals  are  homologous  in
different  teleostean  subgroups  (see  above  and Arratia
1996b: fig. 6, 1997).

5) "Six hypurals present" (Patterson & Rosen 1977). The
correct definition of the character should be: "Six or fewer
hypurals present" (see explanation below).

Six or fewer ossified hypurals (Fig. 14B) are present in
extant clupeocephalans (e.g., see figs. 15-49, 54-73, and
96-111 in Fujita 1990), in contrast to seven or more ossified
hypurals  in  more  basal  forms  such  as  †Leptolepis
coryphaenoides, †Tharsis, †Varasichthyidae (among the
†crossognathiforms), †ichthyodectiforms, Elops, Megalops,
†Lycoptera, and  Hiodon.  However, Late Jurassic basal
euteleosts such as †Leptolepides and †Orthogonikleithrus
retain the primitive condition of seven hypurals (Arratia
1997: figs. 44, 48, 53, 61; Fig. 15C herein), but Cretaceous
euteleosts  such  as  †Manchuricthys,  †Erichalcis  and
†Humbertia, among others, present six or five hypurals
(Arratia  &  Schultze  1992:  fig.  27B-D).  Occasionally,
additional cartilaginous hypurals may be found in early
ontogeny of extant clupeocephalans.

The presence of six or fewer hypurals is not unique to
clupeocephalans among teleosts because the character is
also  present  in  non-clupeocephalans,  such  as  some
†pachyrhyzodontoids  (among  †crossognathiforms),  the
extant elopomorphs  Albula and  Pterothrissus  and more
advanced forms such as notacanthids and anguilliforms
(Schultze & Arratia 1988: figs. 25B, 26, Fujita 1990: figs.
8,  9-14),  and  all  osteoglossomorphs  above  hiodontids
(Hilton 2003: character 71).

According to the evidence presented here and the results
of recent parsimony analyses (e.g., Arratia 1999, 2008a),
the presence of six or fewer hypurals is interpreted as a
homoplastic character for teleosts. Nevertheless, because
of its taxonomic distribution, I interpret the presence of
this  character  in  some  †crossognathiforms,  some
elopomorphs  more  advanced  than  the  basal  elopiforms
Elops  and  Megalops,  some  osteoglossomorphs  more
advanced than the hiodontids, and clupeocephalans as a
character independently acquired in these groups.

6)  "Stegural present" (Arratia 2008a).
The  presence  of  a  stegural  has  been  suggested  as  a
euteleostean character by Patterson & Rosen (1977) and
Arratia (1999). However, in a recent phylogenetic analysis
of basal teleosts (Arratia 2008a) with the †crossognathiforms

Vol. 45, S1, 2010
Revista de Biología Marina y Oceanografía

653

included, the parsimony analysis places the groups with a
stegural at the base of clupeocephalans (including fishes that
previously were interpreted as “salmoniforms”). The stegural
is lost in ostarioclupeomorphs, but present in basal clupeo-
cephalans  †Erichalcis,  †Humbertia,  †Leptolepides,  and
†Orthogonikleithrus (but see Arratia & Tischlinger 2010
where  †Erichalcis,  †Humbertia,  †Leptolepides  and
†Orthogonikleithrus are recovered as euteleosts).

As mentioned above, it is unclear whether the so-called
stegural  is  a  modification  of  the  same  uroneural  in
clupeocephalans, making the homology of this structure
unlikely. The origin and development of the stegural has
only  been  described  and  illustrated  for  salmonids  (see
Arratia  &  Schultze  1991).  Currently,  I  interpret  this
character  as  doubtful,  either  for  clupeocephalans  or
euteleosts, and the only way to solve the problem-in my
opinion-is to study day-to-day ontogenetic series of fishes
interpreted as possessing a stegural, so that the origin of
the element can be known.

DISCUSSION  AND  CONCLUSIONS
The Osteoglossocephala, including the Clupeocephala is
without doubt the largest formal clade among Teleostei. A
great  morphological  diversification  and  consequently
numerous evolutionary transformations through time and
among and within subgroups is expected for such a large
group. These properties, in addition to the high levels of
homoplasies of numerous characters, complicate the study
of this group and its phylogenetic relationships.

One interesting result of this study and re-evaluation of
clupeocephalan  characters  is  that  some  of  the
synapomorphies  that  were  previously  proposed  to  be
uniquely derived for clupeocephalans are interpreted as
homoplastic  when  certain  fossils  are  included  in  the
phylogenetic  analysis  (e.g., Arratia  2008a, Arratia  &
Tischlinger 2010). This confirms again the importance of
fossils in the understanding of the evolutionary history of
certain characters, and obviously, of the evolutionary history
of the group under study (see Arratia 2001, 2004 concerning
the importance of fossils). Another interesting result is that
this  study  demonstrates  the  importance  of  ontogenetic
investigations  for  systematic  and  phylogenetic
interpretations,  including  from  early    to  late  stages  of
development. It shows, once more, that the understanding
of  the  different  elements  of  the  caudal  skeleton,  their
transformations,  their  variations,  and  consequently  the
homologies involved, requires careful observations on the
origin and formation of these structures from early stages

of growth, which may vary among groups. Developmental
investigations are not only a necessity for understanding
the  caudal  skeleton,  but  as  it  is  shown  here,  these
investigations are important for other characters as well.
Other  interesting  result  is  the  discovery  that  several
clupeocephalan synapomorphies are also present in recent
osteoglossomorphs  more  advanced  than  the  primitive
hiodontids, a fact that also changes the interpretation of
some characters as homoplasies.

In sum, re-evaluation of the characters demonstrate the
existence of several problems: (i) several of these characters
are not uniquely derived, but are homoplastic characters
also  found  in  some  †crossognathiforms  among  basal
teleosts  and  in  osteoglossomorphs  above  the  level  of
hiodontids    (e.g.,  fused  anguloarticular,  retroarticular
excluded from the articular surface for quadrate); (ii) others
are absent in most basal forms (e.g., an atrophied or absent
ural neural arch 1); (iii) others are variably present among
basal  clupeocephalans  (e.g.,  toothplates  on  pharyngo-
branchials 2 and 3); and (iv) others seem to be erroneous
(e.g.,  toothplates  primitively  fused  with  the  first  three
pharyngobranchials  and  fifth  ceratobranchial).  Some
characters  as  defined  previously  represent  ambiguous
homologies (e.g., basibranchials 1-3 and basihyal cartilage
are not overlain by medial toothplates; neural arch of ural
centrum 1 [diural terminology] reduced or lost; anteriorly
directed  membranous  outgrowths  developed  from  the
anterodorsal margin of the first uroneural; stegural present).
According to the present evidence the monophyly of the
Clupeocephala is supported by numerous, unambiguous
characters. Several of them, listed below, are apparently
uniquely derived:

1. Autopalatine bone ossifies early in ontogeny.
2. Hyoidean artery pierces ventral hypohyal.
3. Toothplate of cartilaginous fourth pharyngobranchial
element forms by growth of only one toothplate and not by
fusion of several plates.

According to the results presented here, the following
characters are homoplastic because they are also found in
other  groups  outside  the  Clupeocephala,  such  as
in  some  †crossognathiforms  and/or  in  advanced
osteoglossomorphs or because the basal gonorynchiform
Chanos  presents  a  different  condition  in  adult  stage.
Because  of  their  distribution  among  teleosts,  these
characters are interpreted here as independently acquired
in these lineages and, consequently, they may be considered
as clupeocephalan synapomorphies:

  4. Uroneurals are aligned at different angles, instead
of all being inclined toward the horizontal.
  5. Angular and articular bones are fused.
  6. Retroarticular bone is excluded from the articular
facet for the quadrate.
  7. Toothplates on pharyngobranchial 1 are absent.
  8. Toothplates on pharyngobranchial 2 are absent.
  9. Toothplates on pharyngobranchial 3 are absent.
10. Six or fewer hypurals are present.
One  character  that  previously  was  interpreted  as  a
clupeocephalan  synapomorphy  is  proposed  here  as  a
euteleostean synapomorphy:

Neural  arch  of  ural  centrum  1  (of  the  polyural

terminology) is reduced or lost.

The presence of a neural spine on ural centrum 1 may

be a synapomorphy of some clupeomorph subgroups.

Finally, the information provided in this study changes
previous interpretations of certain characters and reveals
the need for further morphological, developmental, and
phylogenetic  studies  based  on  more  elopomorph,
osteoglossomorph, and clupeocephalan taxa, including both
basal and more advanced species. In this way, the meaning
and distribution of the homoplastic characters may be better
understood,  permitting  a  better  interpretation  of  these
characters. A larger study will also facilitate testing which
characters represent unique novelties at certain levels of
Teleostei.
