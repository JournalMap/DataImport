Redescription of the type species of Odontostilbe Cope, 1870

(Teleostei: Characidae: Cheirodontinae), and description of

three new species from the Amazon basin

Cristina M. Bührnheim*,** and Luiz R. Malabarba*,***

The widespread Neotropical cheirodontine Odontostilbe fugitiva is reviewed, and three new species of the genus are de-
scribed from the Amazon basin. A neotype is designated for O. fugitiva, from the mouth of the río Mazán, upper río Amazonas
basin, Peru. Three nominal species are herein considered as synonyms of O. fugitiva: O. madeirae, O. drepanon, and O.
caquetae. The three new species are respectively O. ecuadorensis from the río Napo basin, O. nareuda from the rio Madeira
basin, and O. parecis from the rio Guaporé basin (rio Madeira basin). Among other diagnostic characters, gill rakers are
especially informative in distinguishing species. Description of gill raker denticulation is provided for the first time for species
of the Cheirodontinae. Secondary sexually dimorphic characters are described for all species.

O queirodontíneo neotropical Odontostilbe fugitiva, de ampla distribuição, é revisado e três espécies novas são descritas para
o gênero na bacia Amazônica. Um neótipo é designado para O. fugitiva, da boca do rio Mazán, alto rio Amazonas, Peru. Três
espécies nominais são consideradas sinônimas de O. fugitiva: O. madeirae, O. drepanon e O. caquetae. As três espécies
novas são, respectivamente, O. ecuadorensis da bacia do rio Napo, O. nareuda da bacia do rio Madeira e O. parecis da bacia
do rio Guaporé (bacia do rio Madeira). Entre outros caracteres diagnósticos, os rastros branquiais são especialmente informativos
para  distinguir  as  espécies.  Uma  descrição  da  denticulação  dos  rastros  branquiais  é  apresentada  pela  primeira  vez  para
espécies de Cheirodontinae. Caracteres de dimorfismo sexual secundário são descritos para todas as espécies.

Introduction

The Cheirodontinae contains about 15 genera and 47 spe-
cies of small Neotropical characid fishes, usually attaining 30-
40 mm in standard length (Malabarba, 2003; Malabarba et al.,
2004). Odontostilbe Cope, 1870 was originally defined based
on the presence of a complete lateral line, versus interrupted
in Cheirodon Girard, 1855. The genus initially comprised only
Odontostilbe  fugitiva  Cope,  1870  from  “Pebas,  Eastern
Equador”. Currently, Pebas is a city in the Departamento de
Loreto in Peru, not Ecuador. The taxonomic history of the
discussion of the validity of Odontostilbe versus Cheirodon
dates back to the work of the danish zoologist Christian F.
Lütken. While redescribing Poecilurichthys pulcher Gill, 1858,
Lütken (1875: 236-237) noted that “technically the species of
Trinidad  is  properly  an  Odontostilbe  Cope,  but  this  genus

only differs from the known [Chirodon] G. in the lateral line
which is not complete …” [our translation], referring the spe-
cies as Chirodon (Odontostilbe) pulcher (Gill, 1858). Subse-
quently,  Steindachner  (1882a,  1882b)  described  Chirodon
pequira, and designated the type species of Odontostilbe as
Chirodon  (Odontostilbe)  fugitiva.  Subsequent  works  alter-
nated usage of Odontostilbe as valid (e.g. Eigenmann & Eigen-
mann, 1892, in a preliminary list of freshwater fish of South
American  listed  Odontostilbe  fugitiva  and  recognized
Odontostilbe pulcher), or as synonym of Cheirodon (e.g. Ulrey,
1895, when examining “Characinidae” collected by Charles F.
Hartt  in  Brazil  listed  Cheirodon  fugitiva  and Cheirodon
pulcher, along with five other species of Cheirodon).

Retaining the original diagnostic character of lateral line
complete, Eigenmann (1915) recognized Odontostilbe with
eight species, included in his new subfamily Cheirodontinae:

Redescription of the type species and description of three new species of Odontostilbe

O. fugitiva, O. drepanon Fowler 1913, O. madeirae Fowler
1913, O. microcephala Eigenmann, 1907, O. paraguayensis
Eigenmann & Kennedy, 1903, O. pulchra, O. hastata Eigen-
mann, 1913, and O. melandeta Eigenmann, 1912. Eigenmann
(1915), however, further indicated that  O.  hastata, and  O.
melandeta would be probably moved to other genera. In fact,
O. hastata was afterwards moved into the genus Saccoderma
(Schultz,  1944),  and  O.  melandetum  into  the  genus
Aphyocharacidium (Géry, 1960). Subsequent alternate views
on the validity of Odontostilbe versus Cheirodon based on
the completeness of lateral line were presented by Fink &
Weitzman (1974), who considered Odontostilbe as a synonym
of Cheirodon, and by Fowler (1913, 1940, 1943), Böhlke (1954),
and  Géry  (1964,  1972a,  1972b,  1977),  who  considered
Odontostilbe as valid. Uj (1987) proposed a new diagnosis
for Odontostilbe versus Cheirodon  based  on  some  osteo-
logical characters and included a rearrangement of some spe-
cies of both genera, but his hypothesis was not accepted by
subsequent studies (e.g. Malabarba, 1998, 2003).

Since the establishment of the monophyly of Cheirodon-
tinae and the proposal of a phylogenetic diagnosis of all in-
cluded genera (Malabarba, 1998), Odontostilbe is considered
valid  with  Holoshesthes  Eigenmann,  1903  as  a  synonym.
Cheirodon Girard, 1855 was restricted to six species from
southern  South  America,  and  included  in  the  tribe
Cheirodontini. Six new genera were proposed, and a new tribe
Compsurini was proposed. However, Odontostilbe and four
other genera were left incertae sedis in Cheirodontinae. More
recently, Malabarba (2003) refers ten species to Odontostilbe:
O. dialeptura (Fink & Weitzman, 1974), O. fugitiva, O. graci-
lis Géry, 1960, O. littoris Géry, 1960, O. microcephala, O.
mitoptera (Fink & Weitzman, 1974), O. paraguayensis, O.
pequira, and O. roloffi Géry, 1972. Two of them from Central
America, O. mitoptera and O. dialeptura, were temporarily
referred to Odontostilbe, because both were found to be in-
seminators,  thus  belonging  to  the  tribe  Compsurini
(Malabarba & Weitzman, 1999, 2000).

Herein we provide a redescription of the type species of
Odontostilbe, O. fugitiva, including the designation of a neo-
type, a discussion of its synomyms, and morphological varia-
tion  of  populations  across  the Amazon  basin.  In  order  to
present a better diagnosis for the type-species of the genus,
we also describe herein three new species putatively related
to O. fugitiva from major tributaries of the Amazon basin, one
from upper río Napo and río Putumayo, in Ecuador, and two
from rio Madeira basin, in Brazil and Peru. This is part of a
major systematic study of Odontostilbe.

Material and Methods

Counts and measurements follow Fink & Weitzman (1974),
primarily on the left side of the specimen. Head length is the
distance between the tip of the snout and the posterior end
of subopercle, which is slight posterior to the margin of the
opercle. Total vertebrae number includes the four vertebrae
of the Webberian apparatus, and the terminal “half centrum”

as outlined by Malabarba & Weitzman (1999). The gill raker at
the junction of the ceratobranchial and the epibranchial is
referred as the posteriormost gill raker of the lower branch of
the arch, and counted jointly with the gill rakers on the lower
branch. Specimens were cleared and stained according Tay-
lor & Van Dyke (1985), and/or radiographs were used for
counting vertebrae, teeth, and gill rakers. Scanning Electron
Microscope (SEM) images were obtained from teeth and den-
ticulation of gill rakers. Values of the holotypes and neotype
of O. fugitiva are marked in bold in descriptions.

along with the number of specimens are the following: m -
morphometrics and meristics; c - only meristics; x - meristics
taken from x-rays; c&s - cleared and stained specimens.

As demonstrated by Gonçalves et al. (2005) in the characid
Aphyocharax, sexual dimorphism may start development at
different body sizes, according to gonadal maturation, and
so, body size itself does not allow assuming a given speci-
men lacking male sexually dimorphic features is a female. So,
males and females are recognized only when dissected, or
when showing sexual dimorphism in specimens of similar size
in the same collecting lot. Specimens smaller than the small-
est specimen showing sexual dimorphism in each lot are termed
as unsexed. Specimens of any size belonging to lots where
sexual dimorphism is absent are termed as unsexed.

Statistical analyses. Principal component analysis (PCA) was
used to check overall variation among samples, looking for
differences in morphometrics among species or between sexes,
being an input to multiple regressions (Johnson & Wichern,
1998). PCA on covariances of logarithmically transformed mea-
surements were obtained using Past version 1.28 2004, and
Sigma Plot version 6.10 2000. The first principal component
was partitioned out, considering that it mostly accounts for

C. M. Bührnheim & L. R. Malabarba

169

size variation (Strauss, 1985).

Multiple linear regressions were applied to describe mor-
phometric differences among species or between sexes. An
“overall test for coincidental regressions” as described by
Zar (1996: 368,431), and Souza (1998:72-77) was used to deter-
mine whether the regressions of two set of data are estimat-
ing two species or sexes (H1) or the same population regres-
sion (Ho). The test was applied when regression lines showed
overlapping in confidence limits. The null hypothesis is that
there is a single population underlying all k regressions. The
following formulae were used: F= ((SSR1 - SSR2 / 2) / (SSR2 /
n-4)), where n= number of x, y cases, and n-4 means the sum
of the two residual degrees of freedom. The F value is ob-
tained by calculating sum of squared residuals (SSR) of each
linear regression of any two supposed different species (or
between males and females) (SSRsp1+SSRsp2=SSR2), and
the pooled sum of squared residuals (SSR1) obtained of a
unique linear regression for the same data. The SSR2 < SSR1
indicates two regression lines are better adjusted to the linear
model.  Considering  two  separated  regression  lines  would
better  describe  the  function  between  dependent  and  inde-
pendent variables of two hypothesized different species than
an unique regression line for the same data, the F statistic
would be higher than Fisher’s F (alpha= 0.05), rejecting Ho.
Associated p values were obtained using a F-table.

Diagnosis. The combination of the following characters dis-
tinguish Odontostilbe fugitiva from all the other species of the
genus: (1) mouth terminal, mouth slit nearly at horizontal through
middle of eye (vs. subterminal, mouth slit at horizontal near
lower eye edge in O. euspilura and O. microcephala; or slightly
subterminal, mouth slit at horizontal below middle of eye in O.
dierythrura);  (2)  in  males  snout  not  very  protruding,  but
slighthly pointed or blunt (vs. very protruded in O. euspilura,
O.  microcephala,  and  O.  dierythrura);  (3)  usually  7  large
dentary teeth, with seven cusps (vs. 4 large dentary teeth with
3 large and compressed central cusps and 2, 3 lateral small
cusps in O. pequira); (4) elongation of 2nd unbranched dorsal-
fin ray (vs. no elongation in O. euspilura, or very short elonga-
tion in O. pulchra); (5) pectoral-fin never extending beyond
pelvic-fin origin (vs. extending beyond in males of O. pulchra);
(6) branched anal-fin rays 19-24 (mostly 21-22) [vs. 16-20 (mostly
17-18 in  O.  microcephala, and 17-20 (mostly 18-19) in  O.
euspilura]; (7) 1st to 9th (mostly 6th-7th) anal-fin branched rays of
males with hooks, positioned at distal half-length of fin rays,
tiny  hooks  occasionally  present  distally  up  to  19th  anal-fin
branched ray (vs. well-developed hooks on 1st to 22nd anal-fin
branched rays at distal half length of fin rays in O. pulchra); (8)
no hooks found on 1st unbranched pelvic-fin rays (vs. 1-2 un-
paired hooks per segment on 1st unbranched pelvic-fin ray oc-
casionally present in  O.  euspilura and  O.  pulchra); (9) gill
rakers on upper branch usually 6-7, lower branch usually 12-13
(vs. usually 10-12 on upper branch and 14-16 on lower branch
in O. microcephala; 11-12 on lower branch in O. dierythrura
and O. pulchra; 5-6 on upper branch and 9-10 on lower branch
in O. euspilura; and 7-8 on upper branch and 13-15 on lower
branch in O. pequira); and (10) 4 separate supraneurals (vs.
supraneurals partially fused in O. paraguayensis). Upper gill
raker counts differ O. fugitiva (5-6) from O. ecuadoriensis, O.
nareuda, and O. parecis (6-7).

Description. Morphometric data in Table 1. Largest male 45.1
mm SL, female 48.7 mm SL. Body elongate and compressed.
Males with more compressed bodies than females. Greatest
body  depth  at  dorsal-fin  origin.  Snout  slightly  pointed  or
blunt in males. Head profile gently convex from snout to pos-
terior tip of supraoccipital bone. Predorsal profile slightly
convex  to  straight  between  posterior  tip  of  supraoccipital
bone and dorsal-fin origin, then straight from dorsal-fin ori-
gin to caudal peduncle. Ventral profile convex from mouth tip
to anal-fin origin. Anal-fin base straight. Caudal peduncle
slightly longer than deep.

Head relatively small. Posterior margin of opercle sinusoi-
dal with upper portion concave and lower portion convex.
Mouth terminal, mouth slit nearly at horizontal through middle
of eye. Obliquously positioned maxilla ending at vertical near
or at anterior border of eye and at horizontal on inferior eye
border, not crossing these limits. Dentition (based on 10 c&s
specimens and 17 alcohol specimens). Premaxillary teeth 5-6,
bearing 6-11 cusps (usually 8, 9, and 10); midcentral cusp
longer than others; smaller lateral cusps of each tooth over-
lap cusps of adjacent teeth, except anteriormost teeth (Fig. 2).
Premaxillary teeth juxtaposed external to dentary teeth, leav-
ing premaxillary tooth cusps exposed when mouth closed.
Maxilla with 2-3 teeth bearing 1-9 cusps (mostly 7-9), decreas-
ing cusp number toward posterior tip of maxilla. Dentary teeth
8-10 bearing 1-9 cusps, gradually decreasing in size posteri-
orly, first 6-7 teeth largest with 5-9 cusps (mostly 7), 1 me-
dium-sized tooth with 4-7 cusps and last 1-3 teeth very small,
conic  or  with  2-5  cusps.  Smaller  cusps  of  dentary  teeth
overlaping adjacent tooth cusps, usually not in posteriormost
teeth. All dentary tooth cusps upwardly pointed or slightly
recurved towards interior of mouth.

Dorsal-fin rays ii(259), 8(1), or 9(258). Dorsal-fin origin
slightly posterior to midlength of body, and slightly posterior
to pelvic-fin origin. First unbranched dorsal-fin ray in females
and immature males about half length of second unbranched
dorsal-fin ray. Second unbranched dorsal-fin ray slightly elon-
gate in mature males, extending beyond dorsal-fin distal pro-
file. Anal-fin rays iv(14), v(241) or vi(4), 19(14), 20(57), 21(103),
22(57), 23(23), or 24(5). Anal-fin distal border concave, ante-
rior 6-7 branched rays longest. Pectoral-fin rays i(259), 9(1),
10(11), 11(135), 12(105), or 13(7). Unbranched pectoral-fin ray
reaching or not pelvic-fin origin, never extending beyond that
point. Pelvic-fin rays i(259), 6(4), 7(244), 7i(7), or 8(4). Un-
branched pelvic-fin ray longest in mature males, extending
beyond origin of anal fin. Lateral skin border of unbranched
pectoral-fin ray and unbranched pelvic-fin ray thickened in
mature males, bearing thin laterodorsal projection of hard tis-
sue covered with soft tissue. Principal caudal-fin rays 19(254),
rarely 16(1), 17(1), 18(7) or 20(2). Procurrent caudal-fin rays:
dorsal 10(34), 11(113), 12(96), 13(9), or 14(4); ventral 7(1), 8(14),
9(133), 10(94), or 11(14). Anterior 1 or 2 ventral procurrent
caudal-fin rays sometimes laterally expanded, bifurcated, or
S-shaped. Caudal-fin ray flaps ventrally on 2nd-8th (mostly 4th-

Males with acute, elongate, retrorse hooks on posterior
margin of pelvic- and anal-fin rays. One or two (rarely 3) paired
and unpaired hooks per segment of lepidotrichia, on last un-
branched anal-fin ray, and 1st to 8th (mostly 6th-7th) anal-fin
branched rays, positioned at distal half-length and not ex-
tending to ray tip; tiny hooks can be present distally up to
19th anal-fin branched rays in very developed males (e.g. INPA
18506, ANSP 178908, ANSP 15006, and neotype). One or two
(rarely 3) unpaired and long hooks per segment of lepidotrichia
along almost all length of 1st to 7th branched pelvic-fin rays,

Redescription of the type species and description of three new species of Odontostilbe

Color in alcohol. General ground body color brownish or
pale yellow. Dark dorsum pigmentation from head to caudal
peduncle, dark chromatophores mostly on border of scales
forming reticulated pattern. Pigmented scales extend laterally
on body below longitudinal stripe, also on pseudotympanum
area or not. Dorsal fin entirely scattered with dark chromato-
phores along fin rays, densely along 1st-2nd unbranched dor-
sal-fin rays. Dark chromatophores along 1st-9th dorsal branched
fin rays, except almost hyaline 9th branched fin ray. Pectoral
and  pelvic  fins  with  scattered  dark  chromatophores,  more
numerous on anteriormost portions of fins. Fresh specimens
only with 7th branched pelvic-fin ray hyaline. Neotype with 1-
5th branched pelvic-fin rays pigmented. Pelvic fin mainly hya-
line in old-preserved specimens. Anal fin with dark chromato-
phores spread on all fin rays or on more central branched
anal-fin rays, except at tips of last unbranched fin rays and 1st
branched fin ray. Adipose fin not pigmented. Caudal fin al-
most entirely covered with diffuse dark chromatophores along
fin rays, except clear areas on base of caudal-fin lobes just
behind caudal-fin spot. Rounded black to brown spot on base
of caudal fin, reaching upper and lower border of peduncle,
or upper border only, sometimes extending little onto proxi-
mal portion of 7th to 12th central principal caudal-fin rays.

Numerous dark chromatophores, somewhat contiguous,
on snout, upper and lower lips, anteriormost portion of max-
illa, and 1st, 2nd, and 6th infraorbitals. Top of head on frontals
and  parietals  pigmented,  with  deep-lying  dark  chromato-
phores over brain membranes below frontals and parietals,
and fontanel. Body with faint dark and silver midlateral stripe,
sometimes forming black line along middle longitudinal body
axis, beginning behind or on pseudotympanum, above lateral
line, and reaching caudal spot. Guanine on eye iris, opercle,
isthmus, and most of 3rd infraorbital. Below lateral line, belly
faint  almost  without  pigmentation,  chromatophores  above
anal-fin base forming 12 to 15 chevron shaped markings.

Color in life. Life color of specimen from lower Ucayali drain-
age (Fig. 4). One red spot on base of each caudal fin lobe, just
posterior to caudal fin black blotch. Red and yellow pigments
most on dorsal and anal fins. White pigment on tips of last
unbranched  and  1st-2nd branched  anal-fin  rays,  and  of  un-
branched and first branched pelvic-fin rays.

Sexual dimorphism. Males with hooks on anal- and pelvic-
fin rays, and elongate dorsal- and pelvic-fin rays, in contrast
to absence of these features in females. A gill gland (Burns &
Weitzman, 1996) present in mature males on first gill arch,
covering about 8 to 10 anterior branchial filaments (Fig. 3).
Sexual dimorphism in general body shape is also recognized
by principal component analysis performed on measurements
of males and females (Fig. 5). Principal component 2 (PC2)
grouped males and females separately. It was affected strongly
and negatively by pelvic-fin length, snout length, and dor-
sal-fin length; and positively by depth at dorsal-fin origin.
Males are particularly distinct from females in all of these
characters, having higher values of pelvic-fin length, snout

lar denticle on posterolateral border; lower gill rakers with 1-
4 denticles on anterolateral border, and none or 1 on postero-
lateral surface; and posteriormost lower gill raker with none
or 1 recurved denticle on anterolateral border, and none, 1 or
2 similar denticles on posterolateral border (Fig. 3). Denticu-
lation mainly on basal portion of gill rakers.

length, and dorsal-fin length than females, while females have
higher depth values at dorsal-fin origin than males (Table 1).
Principal component 3 (PC3) was affected strongly and posi-
tively by snout length and upper jaw length, and negatively
by pelvic-fin length and dorsal-fin length. Variation on PC3
seems to be related to the level of development of pelvic- and
dorsal-fin rays, snout protusion (snout length, and upper jaw
length) in males, because males with higher values for these
features are located upper on PC3 axis (Fig. 5).

Remarks on the holotype of Odontostilbe fugitiva. The short
description of O. fugitiva by Cope (1870) makes no reference
to type specimens. Most type-specimens of fishes described
by Cope were deposited at ANSP, although some at USNM
and some are missing (Böhlke, 1984; Vari & Howe, 1991).
Henry W. Fowler was the first full-time curator of the fish
collection at ANSP, and one of his first tasks was the catalog-
ing of the extensive collection of Edward D. Cope (Böhlke,
1984). During his stay at ANSP, Fowler (1913: 529, 532) de-
scribed O. madeirae and O. drepanon and Fowler (1940) O.
dierythrura and  O.  hasemani, but he did not mention any
type specimens for O. fugitiva. Finally, when describing O.
caquetae, Fowler (1943: 232) stated that the type of O. fugitiva
was lost. Géry (1972a) also affirmed the holotype of O. fugitiva
was lost after visiting ASNP to study Fowler’s type material.
Vari & Howe (1991) did not list O. fugitiva among characiform
type specimens at USNM.

Böhlke (1984: 46) indicated ANSP 8059 as the holotype of
O. fugitiva, and noticed that “original Cope label and catalog
indicate this to be type of O. fugitiva”. However, in the same
publication, Böhlke (1984: 46) remarked the same lot (ANSP
8059)  was  listed  by  Fowler  (1906)  as  the  holotype  of
Aphyocharax filigerus, valid as Prionobrama filigera (Cope,
1870). Examination of ANSP 8059 confirmed this is a speci-
men of P. filigera. Both authors have fruitlessly searched the
ANSP and USNM fish collections after the type material of O.
fugitiva [including the lot ANSP 8073 listed by Fowler (1906)
as cotypes of Aphyocharax filigerus].

Neotype designation. Odontostilbe fugitiva is the type spe-
cies of  Odontostilbe, and the designation of a neotype, as
well as establishment of the identity of the type species is
essential  in  solving  nomenclatural  questions  among
cheirodontines.  The  neotype  was  not  caught  at  Pebas,  the
original type locality of O. fugitiva. Pebas is located at the
confluence of río Ampyiacu with río Amazonas, Loreto, Peru.
The neotype is a mature male from an affluent of lower río
Napo basin, río Mazán, upper rio Amazonas, Loreto, Peru.
Río Mazán is to the west of the type locality, being the near-
est site (Fig. 6) with the best preserved mature male (Fig. 1)
available, being in conformity with ICZN (1999). Since sec-
ondary sexually dimorphic characters are important to distin-
guish Odontostilbe and other Cheirodontinae genera, a ma-
ture male is preferred as the neotype. The chosen male has
entire elongate 2nd unbranched dorsal-fin ray and unbranched

pelvic-fin rays, well-developed acute retrorse hooks on pel-
vic- and anal-fin rays, preserved scales, and well-preserved
color pattern (Fig. 1). Cope (1870: 566) referred to a “trans-
verse line [of scales] at vent 11; at ventral fins 5-5”. Although
distinct  from  the  counts  of  the  neotype,  these  counts  are
included in the range found herein for the species (5-7 be-
tween lateral line and dorsal-fin origin and 4-5 between lateral
line and anal-fin origin).

The  status  of  Odontostilbe  madeirae  and Odontostilbe
drepanon. Both species were described in the same paper by
Fowler (1913). The holotype (Fig. 7) and all paratypes but one
of O. drepanon have the dimorphic characters unique to males
of Odontostilbe: elongation of 2nd unbranched dorsal-fin ray
and 1st unbranched pelvic-fin rays, and presence of hooks on
pelvic-fin rays and anal-fin rays. On the other hand, the holo-
type (Fig. 7) and all paratypes of O. madeirae lack these char-
acters, and have higher body depth, the diagnostic features
for females (see Table 1 and description under Sexual Dimor-
phism above). The two species described by Fowler (1913)
overall match the O. fugitiva diagnosis, and this is a case of
misunderstanding dimorphic males and females as two differ-
ent species. Fowler (1913: 529) remarked that the absence of
“the dark-edged silver lateral band” in O. madeirae is a char-
acter  to  distinguish  it  from  O.  fugitiva.  The  holotype  and
paratypes of O. madeirae actually have a faded longitudinal
line of chromatophores posterior to the pseudotympanum.
The holotype of O. madeirae has few dentary teeth re-
maining, but laterally 4 teeth remain, each with 7 cusps. Pre-
maxillary teeth 5 with 7-8 cusps and maxillary teeth 2 with 7
cusps. The holotype of O. drepanon also lacks most dentary
teeth, but on the right side four teeth remain each with about
7 cusps. Premaxillary teeth 5 with 7-9 cusps, and maxillary
teeth 2 with 7 cusps. The 2nd unbranched dorsal-fin ray is
broken.

female 32.1 mm SL (top), and Odontostilbe drepanon. ANSP
39210, male 30.5 mm SL (bottom - The darkned area below
dorsal fin is a preservation artifact).

The status of Odontostilbe caquetae. Odontostilbe caquetae
was described from a single immature specimen (28.0 mm SL).
Fowler diagnosed O. caquetae comparing the holotype with
data  available  in  the  short  redescription  of  O.  fugitiva  by
Eigenmann (1915:93), which was based on four specimens
examined from “San Antonio de Rio Madeira”, measuring
“largest 41 mm”. Following Fowler’s diagnosis, O. caquetae
would have a smaller head, smaller eye and larger snout than
O. fugitiva. However, measurements and counts of the holo-
type of O. caquetae overlap those of O. fugitiva (Table 1),
not  supporting  any  of  Fowler’s  diagnostic  characters.  For
that  reason,  we  consider  O.  caquetae  as  a  synonym  of  O.
fugitiva.

The holotype is now dark colored and damaged with most
dorsal-fin rays and caudal-fin rays broken (Fig. 8). Infraorbitals
2-5 are lacking on the left side. Premaxilla probably would
have five teeth, but just two of them remain on each left and
right sides, bearing 8-7 cusps. Right maxilla with 2 teeth bear-
ing 8-9 cusps, and left maxilla with only one tooth with 8
cusps. Four dentary teeth remain on each side bearing 5-6
cusps. This dentition is similar to that found in smaller speci-
mens of O. fugitiva, O. pulchra, O. euspilura or O. ecuador-
ensis.  The  type  locality  of  O.  caquetae  is  Florencia,  río
Portuguesa, río Caqueta drainage, where O. euspilura occurs
(Fowler,  1945b).  The  main  reason  for  not  considering  O.

caquetae as synonym of O. euspilura is the terminal mouth
in the former, against the inferior mouth in the latter.

The first right gill arch of the holotype was found cut off
from  branchial  apparatus,  but  kept  under  the  operculum.
Both first gill arches have 6 gill rakers on upper branch and
11 on lower branch. Fowler (1943: 232) described 7+11 gill
rakers and it is possible the first gill raker was lost in the
damaged upper branches of both gill arches. Specimens of
Odontostilbe examined from rio Japurá, the Brazilian name
for mid and lower río Caqueta, match O. fugitiva in measure-
ments and counts, including 6, 7 gill rakers on upper gill
arch and 12 on lower (one among 10 examined specimens of
rio Japurá has 6+11 gill rakers as the holotype of O. caquetae).
Therefore  we  consider  O.  caquetae  as  synonym  of  O.
fugitiva. However, we consider this synonym provisional
since no mature males of Odontostilbe were available from
upper río Caqueta or rio Japurá.

Distribution  and  geographical  variation.  Odontostilbe
fugitiva is the most widespred  Odontostilbe species in the
Amazon basin, occurring from the major western tributaries
to the lower rio Amazonas (Fig. 6). More extense records are
from the río Ucayali, río Marañon, rio Amazonas and rio Ma-
deira basins. Records from western major tributaries of the
Amazon, Purus and Juruá systems, are relatively scarce. Pre-
dominantly, the species occurs in major whitewater rivers of
the Amazon basin, being not so far identified from the rio
Negro, rio Trombetas, rio Tapajós, rio Xingu, rio Tocantins-
Araguaia. The well-sampled fish fauna of the rio Negro did
not reveal O. fugitiva (Goulding et al., 1988), though they
listed 12 specimens of “Cheirodon sp.” (not found at INPA
collection). Chao (2001) also did not include O. fugitiva in a
list of fishes of rio Negro basin and lower rio Branco caught
by Project Piaba. Personal searches [CMB] at INPA and Project
Piaba fish collections failed in finding O. fugitiva in rio Negro

material. Lowe McConnell (1991) listed O. cf. fugitiva from a
tributary of the rio Araguaia, the rio das Mortes. However,
the examination of material from the rio Araguaia basin failed
to reveal any O. fugitiva.

Specimens from upper río Marañon, upper río Ucayali
drainages, and middle rio Amazonas (rio Solimões) showed
some variation in morphometry. This seems to be related to
some exceptionally developed males and females in samples
from  upper  portions  of  Marañon  and  Ucayali.  Indeed,  the
largest mature specimens of O. fugitiva come from upper río
Pastaza, Ecuador (FMNH 113515), and upper río Huallaga,
Peru (ANSP 136951), both upper affluents of Maranõn, with
some comparable size specimens only from río Urubamba,
upper Ucayali. Noteworthy, males from río Marañon basin
(río Pastaza, río Tigre, and río Huallaga) show a tendency to
have longer snout lengths and upper jaw lengths than males
of  most  populations  of  upper  río Amazonas  basin  (río
Putumayo, río Itaya, río Mazán, río Ampyiacu, río Yavari, and
the río Amazonas). However, no additional differences were
found to support the recognition of a separate species for río
Marañon basin. Some specimens from the upper río Pastaza
(FMNH 113515) show a somewhat subterminal mouth similar
to O.  dierythrura  and  other  undescribed  species  from  río
Madre  de  Dios,  upper  rio  Madeira  basin.  Odontostilbe
dierythrura and this undescribed species, however, possess
larger upper jaw length (Fig. 9), and more pronounced snouts
than O. fugitiva, including the Marañon population.

Males of río Ucayali basin also had differences in snout
and upper jaw length when contrasted with males from the
main rio Amazonas basin, having snout length difference sta-
tistically significant in the coincidental regression test (F(2,
74)= 11.8, p<0.00) (Fig. 10). When compared to O. fugitiva, O.
dierythrura and Odontostilbe n. sp. from Madre de Dios, the
upper jaw length of the population from río Urubamba, upper
Ucayali, remains at an intermediate range between O. fugitiva
and the other two species (Fig. 11). Again, considering there

were  no  additional  characters  differing  these  populations,
and the overlaps in statistics for snout length and upper jaw
length, the Ucayali population is considered to be O. fugitiva.
A significant statistical difference in measurements was
also found when comparing rio Solimões samplings from the
region near Manaus to overall O. fugitiva material from upper
rio Amazonas basin, including río Ucayali and río Marañon
systems.  Not  only  males,  but  females  and  unsexed  speci-
mens jointly, show differences in snout to pectoral-fin length
(F(2, 200) = 85.6, p<0.00) (Fig. 12). This difference is also consid-
ered a variation among O. fugitiva populations. However, there
is a lack of mature males and females among specimens avail-
able from an extensive portion of the rio Solimões between

Letícia, Colombia, and Manaus, Brazil. Most samples from
Solimões consisted of material caught near Manaus by Peter
Bayley in 1970s or more recently by INPA researchers.

Examined specimens from rio Juruá basin are unsexed,
probably juveniles. Exceptionally, two specimens among 8,
have 8 upper gill rakers, and 3 specimens have 14 lower gill
rakers  (Fig.  13a).  Higher  gill  raker  counts  occur  in  O.
dierythrura and in an undescribed species from Madre de
Dios. However, the upper jaw lengths of the avaliable speci-
mens  of  Juruá  fit  that  of  O.  fugitiva.  One  specimen  of  O.
fugitiva from the rio Madeira also has 14 lower gill rakers
(Fig. 13b). Similarly, specimens examined from rio Purus con-
tain only unsexed specimens. In the lack of fully developed,
mature  specimens,  we  tentatively  assign  Juruá  and  Purus
specimens to O. fugitiva.

Ecological notes. Recorded mainly from whitewaters; black-
water as “black-muddy” is cited only for FMNH 85346, a
stream near Leticia, Colombia. Sánchez-Botero & Araújo-Lima

of  aquatic  macrophytes  during  high  water  period  at  three

listed Odontostilbe  aff.  piaba  caught  under  macrophytes
Eichhornia azurea and Eichhornia crassipes in lago Cama-
leão, considering Odontostilbe among the typical fish gen-
era associated to Eichhornia spp., along with Ctenobrycon,
Synbranchus, Hemigrammus, Moenkhausia, Mylossoma, and
Hoplias. Some of the fish collected by Sánchez-Botero &
Araújo-Lima (2001) were examined at INPA. Three distinct
species of Cheirodontinae were identified by those authors
as “O. fugitiva”, including two Serrapinnus species, plus O.
fugitiva.  That  is  not  surprising,  since  O.  piaba  [actually
Serrapinnus piaba] for example is used in the literature as a
misidentification  of  several  Serrapinnus  spp.  In  any  case,
Sánchez-Botero & Araújo-Lima (2001) results pointed out a
high abundance of the cheirodontine O. fugitiva and at least
three Serrapinnus spp.  (Serrapinnus  micropterus,
Serrapinnus gr. microdon, and Serrapinnus n. sp., our iden-
tifications) in lakes from the rio Solimões floodplain. Peter
Bayley fish collections undertaken during the late 1970’s from
the same lakes were also extensively examined (material at
ANSP, MCP, and USNM), confirming that O. fugitiva is very
common  in  these  floodplain  lakes. At  the  same  localities,
Marchantaria Isle (lago Camaleão), Janauacá, and Janauari,
O.  fugitiva was caught associated with macrophytes  Echi-
nochloa polystachya, E. crassipes, Paspalum repens, Pani-
cum sp., or unvegetated places, and considered as omnivorous
(Petry et al., 2003).

Two new cheirodontine species provisionally treated as
“Odontostilbe”, but not described herein, are sympatric and
have been found mixed with O. fugitiva in some jars. One of
these new species mostly occurs in the río Ucayali basin and
the second in the río Marañon basin.

Diagnosis. Characters that diagnose Odontostilbe ecuador-
ensis are: (1) upper gill rakers 5-6, lower 9-11, mostly 10-11 (vs.
upper gill rakers 6-8, mostly 6-7, and lower 11-14, usually 12 in
O. fugitiva (Fig. 13a-b); (2) denticulation of gill rakers more
numerous in O. ecuadorensis than in O. fugitiva (in speci-
mens larger than 32.5 mm SL), mainly on posteriormost gill
raker of lower arch (5-6 denticles on basal portions of gill
raker in O. ecuadorensis vs. 0-2 in O. fugitiva (Figs. 3, 16); (3)
elongate 2nd unbranched dorsal-fin ray (vs. not elongate in O.
euspilura and very short elongate in O. pulchra); (4) no hooks
on unbranched pelvic-fin ray (vs. 1-2 unpaired hooks per seg-
ment on 1st unbranched pelvic-fin ray occasionally present in
O. euspilura and O. pulchra); (5) 1-3 paired or unpaired hooks
per segment on last unbranched anal-fin ray, and 1st to 16th
anal-fin branched rays (small hooks like knots on anal-fin ray
branches, usually on 10th branched fin ray and following rays)
(vs. well-developed hooks on 1st to 22nd anal-fin branched rays
at distal half length of fin rays in O. pulchra); and (6) usually
seven  large  dentary  teeth,  with  seven  cusps  (vs. 4  large
dentary teeth with 3 large and compressed central cusps and
2, 3 lateral small cusps in O. pequira). Odontostilbe ecuador-
ensis differs from sympatric O. euspilura by its terminal mouth
(vs. subterminal mouth).

Description. Morphometric data given in Table 2. Slender
and large Odontostilbe species, largest male (holotype) 45.7
mm SL, largest female 47.7 mm SL. Body elongate and com-
pressed, more compressed in males than females. Greatest
body  depth  at  dorsal-fin  origin.  Snout  pointed  in  males,
rounded in females. Head profile slightly convex from snout
to dorsal-fin origin; profile descends from that point almost
straight to caudal peduncle. Ventral profile convex from lower
jaw to caudal peduncle. Anal-fin base straight. Caudal pe-
duncle slightly longer than deep.

Head relatively small. Posterior margin of opercle sinusoi-
dal with upper portion concave and lower portion convex.
Mouth terminal. Maxilla short terminates at vertical near or at
anterior eye border, horizontal to lower eye border. Dentition
(based on 6 c&s specimens and 28 alcohol specimens). Pre-
maxillary teeth 4, 5, or 6, bearing 5-9 cusps (usually 7, 8, or 9);
midcentral cusp longest, lateral cusps overlap cusps of adja-
cent teeth (Fig. 15). Premaxillary teeth juxtaposed external to
dentary teeth, leaving premaxillary tooth cusps exposed when
mouth closed. Maxilla with 2 or 3 teeth bearing 1-9 (usually 7)
cusps, decreasing cusp number toward posterior tip of max-
illa. Dentary teeth 8-9 gradually decreasing in size posteri-
orly, anterior 6 teeth large bearing 5-7 cusps (usually 7), and
posterior teeth small, conic or with 2-5 cusps. Smaller cusps
of dentary teeth overlap cusps of adjacent teeth, usually not
in posteriormost teeth.

Dorsal-fin rays ii(89), 9(89). Dorsal fin slightly posterior
to mid body length, and slightly posterior to pelvic-fin origin.
First unbranched dorsal-fin ray in females and immature males
about half length of second unbranched dorsal-fin ray. Sec-
ond unbranched dorsal-fin ray elongate in mature males, ex-
tending beyond dorsal-fin distal profile. Anal-fin rays iii(1),
iv(8), v(78), vi(2); 18(3), 19(15), 20(34), 21(31), or 22(6). Anal-
fin distal border concave, anterior 6-7 branched rays longest.
Pectoral-fin rays i(89), 10(8), 11(55), or 12(26). Unbranched
pectoral-fin ray reaching or not pelvic-fin origin, never ex-
tending beyond pelvic-fin origin. Pelvic-fin rays i(89), 6(1),
7(87), or 8(1). Unbranched pelvic-fin rays longest in mature
males, extending beyond origin of anal fin. Lateral skin bor-
der of unbranched pectoral-fin rays and unbranched pelvic-
fin rays thickened in mature males, bearing thin laterodorsal
projection of hard tissue covered with soft tissue. Principal
caudal-fin rays 19(89). Procurrent caudal-fin rays: dorsal 8(1),
9(3), 10(5), 11(31), 12(44), or 13(5); ventral 8(5), 9(33), 10(41),
11(9), or 12(1). Sometimes 1-2 anterior ventral procurrent cau-
dal-fin rays laterally expanded, bifurcated, or S-shaped. Cau-
dal-fin ray flaps ventrally on 3rd-8th rays of upper lobe, dor-
sally on 12th-16th rays of lower lobe. Adipose-fin at vertical
through to last anal-fin ray insertion.

Males with robust, elongate, retrorse hooks on poste-
rior border of pelvic- and anal-fin rays. One to 3 paired or
unpaired  hooks  per  segment  on  last  unbranched  anal-fin
ray, and 1st to 16th branched anal-fin rays, more developed
from 1st to usually 7th rays and very small like knots usually
on 10th branched fin ray and following rays. Hooks on middle
portion  of  anterior  rays  and  on  distal  portion  after  3rd
branched  anal-fin  ray.  One  to  3  unpaired  acute,  elongate
hooks per segment of lepidotrichia along almost entire length
of 1st to 7th branched pelvic-fin rays, and reaching tip of fin
rays (except on 1st branched pelvic-fin ray, on midlenght
portion). No hooks found on 1st unbranched pelvic-fin ray.
One or two hooks on anterior border of branches of anal-fin
rays. One or two hooks on anterior border of branches of
pelvic-fin rays.

phores on unbranched pelvic-fin ray. Anal fin mostly clear
with few dark chromatophores. Some specimens bearing dark
chromatophores on distal portion of middle branched anal-
fin rays. Adipose fin not pigmented. Caudal fin almost en-
tirely covered with diffuse dark chromatophores along fin
rays, except light areas on base of caudal-fin lobes just be-
hind  caudal-fin  spot.  Somewhat  rounded  brownish  caudal
spot on base of caudal fin, reaching upper border of peduncle,
but  never  reaching  lower  border,  sometimes  extending  on
proximal portion of 7th to 12th central caudal-fin rays (speci-
mens from río Cuyabeno). Holotype is not well-pigmented,
with pelvic and anal fins hyaline.

Black chromatophores on snout, upper lip, sometimes on
lower lip, anteriormost portion of maxilla, and 1st, 2nd, and 6th
infraorbitals. Pigmentation on top of head on frontals, and
parietals  with  deep-lying  dark  chromatophores  over  brain
membranes below frontals and parietals, and fontanel. Body
with faint dark and silver midlateral stripe, sometimes reduced
to one or two parallel lines, along middle longitudinal body
axis, beginning above pseudotympanum, above lateral line,
and reaching caudal spot. Guanine on eye iris, opercle, isth-
mus, and most of 3rd, 4th, and 5th infraorbitals. Below lateral
line, belly faint, chromatophores just above anal fin-base form-
ing 6 to 10 chevron shaped markings.

Sexual dimorphism. Males with hooks on anal- and pelvic-
fin rays, elongate dorsal- and pelvic-fin rays, in contrast to
absence of these features in females (see description). Gill
gland (Burns & Weitzman, 1996) presents on first gill arch in
mature males, covering about 8 to 12 anterior branchial fila-
ments (Fig. 16). Principal component analysis of morphomet-
ric data of males and females denotes sexual dimorphism in
general body shape (Fig. 17). Principal component 2 (PC2)
grouped males and females separately, being affected strongly
and negatively by snout length, pelvic-fin length, and caudal
peduncle length; and positively by depth at dorsal-fin origin.
Males are distinguished from females in all these characters,
showing higher values of snout length, pelvic-fin length, and
caudal  peduncle  length  than  females,  while  females  have
higher values of body depth at dorsal-fin origin than males
(Table 2). Principal component 3 (PC3) was affected strongly
and  positively  by  snout  length  and  upper  jaw  length,  and
negatively by pelvic-fin length and dorsal-fin length. Some
males have well-developed dorsal and pelvic-fin rays, and
protuding  snouts  (greater  snout  length,  and  upper  jaw
length). This correlates with their heaviest loadings in PC3
forming a group on upper left corner of the graph (Fig. 17).

Distribution. Río Napo, río Putumayo, and río Pastaza basins
(a single lot known for the latter) (Fig. 18). Nearly all material
from Ecuador, and some lots from Peru on border with Ecua-
dor. The species is also recorded on lower río Napo basin in
sympatry with O. fugitiva.

Etymology. The epithet ecuadorensis refers to the country
where the species was first discovered.

none to 3 on lateral border of lower gill rakers). All denticula-
tion mostly on basal portion of gill rakers.

Color in alcohol. General ground body color brownish yel-
low. Dark dorsum pigmentation from head to caudal peduncle,
chromatophores mostly on border of scales. Pigmented scales
extend laterally on body above longitudinal stripe, sometimes
on pseudotympanum area in well-pigmented specimens. Dark
chromatophores on all dorsal-fin rays, along 1st and 2nd un-
branched fin rays and faint on 1st-8th branched dorsal-fin rays,
almost hyaline on 9th branched ray. Dark chromatophores on
1st unbranched pectoral-fin ray, less numerous on 1st and 2nd
branched fin rays, following branched rays practically hya-
line. Pelvic fins usually hyaline, with some dark chromato-

Ecological  notes.  Saul  (1975)  identified  Odontostilbe  cf.
madeirae Fowler, 1913, and Holoshesthes heterodon Eigen-
mann, 1915 as two cheirodontine species commonly taken
together in the río Aguarico, the former primarily feeding on
algae and plant material, and the latter on insects and insect
larvae. However, examination of Saul’s (1975) material proved
the species named O. cf. madeirae to be a mix of O. ecuador-
ensis described herein and O. euspilura. The material he named
H. heterodon consist of an undescribed cheirodontine. Part
of the specimens caugth by W. Saul was selected herein as
type material for O. ecuadorensis. These Ecuadorian species
are reported to occur in clearwater, blackwater or turbid wa-
ters, riverine sandy-beaches (Stewart et al., 2002), or lagoons
and associated tributaries (Galacatos  et  al., 1996). All the
material examined for this study came from altitudes between
200-500 m. Galacatos et al. (1996) recognized two altitudinal
regions in Ecuadorian Amazon, lowland between 200 m and
220 m, and piedmont between 235 m and 295 m, where most
Odontostilbe species were caught, preferentially in lagoons
rather than streams.

branch 5-6 and lower branch 11-12 of O. nareuda differ from
sympatric species O. fugitiva with mostly 6-7 on upper and
12-13 on lower (Figs. 13a-b).

Description. Morphometric data given in Table 3. Largest
male 33.1 mm SL; female 32.3 mm SL. Body elongate and com-
pressed. Greatest body depth at dorsal-fin origin. Snout usu-
ally pointed; not protuded in males. Dorsal profile ascends
slightly convex from snout to dorsal-fin origin, and descends
straight from that point to caudal peduncle. Ventral profile
convex from lower jaw to anal-fin origin, and straight along
anal-fin base. Caudal peduncle slightly longer than deep.

Head relatively small. Posterior margin of opercle sinusoi-
dal with upper portion concave and lower portion convex.
Mouth terminal. Maxilla short, oblique; posterior tip reaching
near or to vertical at anterior eye border, and ending at level
of inferior eye border. Cleared and stained specimens (2). Pre-
maxillary teeth 5, bearing 7-9 cusps; midcentral cusp longer
than lateral cusps; smaller lateral cusps of each tooth overlap
cusps of adjacent teeth, except anteriormost teeth (Fig. 21).

Premaxillary teeth juxtaposed externally to dentary teeth, leav-
ing premaxillary tooth cusps exposed when mouth closed.

anterior branched rays longer than posterior rays. Pectoral-
fin rays i(17), 9(1), 10(9), or 11(7). Unbranched pectoral-fin
ray reaching or not reaching pelvic-fin origin, extending be-
yond pelvic-fin origin in mature males. Pelvic-fin rays i(20),
6(1), or 7(19). No evident elongation of unbranched dorsal or
pelvic-fin rays in males. Lateral skin border of unbranched
pectoral-fin rays and unbranched pelvic-fin rays thickened in
mature males, bearing thin laterodorsal projection of hard tis-
sue covered with soft tissue. Principal caudal-fin rays 19(20).
Procurrent caudal-fin rays: dorsal 11(7), 12(8), or 13(2); ven-
tral 9(7) or 10(10). Sometimes anterior ventral procurrent cau-
dal-fin rays modified, distally bifurcated. Caudal-fin ray flaps
ventrally on 4th-7th rays of upper lobe, and dorsally on 14th-15th
rays of lower lobe. Adipose-fin at vertical through last anal-
fin ray insertion.

Holotype and paratype males of FMNH 106433 are unique,
all  having  not  totally  developed  hooks.  Males  with  acute,
retrorse hooks on posterior margin of pelvic and anal-fin rays.
One  or  two paired  or  unpaired  hooks  per  segment  of
lepidotrichia on last unbranched anal-fin ray, and 1st to 9th
anal-fin branched rays, positioned at middistal length of rays.
One or two unpaired hooks per segment of lepidotrichia along
almost entire length of 1st to 7th branched pelvic-fin rays, and
reaching tip of fin rays (except on 1st branched pelvic-fin ray,
on midlenght portion).

Scales  cycloid;  lateral  line  complete  35(1)  or  36(6);
predorsal row 10(6) or 11(10); scale rows between lateral line
and dorsal-fin origin 5(7) or 6(6); scale rows between lateral
line and anal-fin origin 4(15), scale near pelvic-fin origin usu-
ally smaller than others); scale rows around caudal peduncle
14(7). Triangular modified scale on pelvic-fin base extends
posteriorly covering 1-3 scales. Scales on anal-fin base 6-7.
Cleared and stained specimens (2): supraneurals 4(1) or

5(1); precaudal vertebrae, 16(2); caudal vertebrae 19(2). Gill
rakers (counted in 15 alcohol specimens, and 2 c&s), upper
5(3) or 6(13); lower 10(3), 11(7), or 12(6) (1-2 on hypobran-
chial). Upper gill rakers with 1-3 recurved denticles on antero-
lateral border, and none or 1 similar denticle on posterolateral
border; lower gill rakers with none to 3 recurved denticles on
anterolateral border (1-4 anteriormost lower gill rakers with
none or 1 denticle on posterolateral border); posteriormost
lower gill raker with 3 denticles on anterolateral border, and 1-
2 similar denticles on posterolateral border (Fig. 22). All den-
ticulation mainly on basal portion of gill rakers.

Color in alcohol. General ground body color brownish or
pale yellow. Dorsal portion of body dark from head to caudal
peduncle;  dark  chromatophores  mostly  on  scale  borders,
forming reticulated pattern. Pigmented scales not extending
laterally  on  body,  no  distinct  dark  chromatophores  on
pseudotympanum area. Dorsal fin entirely with dark chro-
matophores scattered along all fin rays, more densely along
1st and 2nd unbranched dorsal-fin rays. Pectoral and pelvic
fins with scattered dark chromatophores, more numerous on
anteriormost portions of fins. Holotype with pelvic fins hya-
line. Anal fin mostly pigmented, dark chromatophores spread
on all fin rays, except at tips of last unbranched fin ray and 1st
branched fin ray. Adipose fin hyaline. Caudal fin almost en-
tirely covered with diffuse dark chromatophores along fin
rays, clear areas on base of caudal-fin lobes just behind cau-
dal-fin spot. Rounded black to brown spot on base of caudal
fin, reaching upper and lower border of peduncle, usually
lighter near ventral border, sometimes extending little on proxi-
mal portion of 7th to 12th central caudal-fin rays.

Numerous  chromatophores  on  snout,  as  well  as  upper
and lower lips (on lower lip these almost form line). Numerous

188

dark chromatophores on anteriormost portion of maxilla, and
1st infraorbital. Pigmentation on top of head on frontals and
parietals, and deep-lying dark chromatophores cover brain
membranes below frontals, parietals, and fontanel. Body with
faint dark midlateral stripe, sometimes reduced to line along
longitudinal body axis, beginning below dorsal fin, above
lateral line, and extending to caudal spot. Belly pale, almost
without chromatophores below lateral line, except above anal-
fin base with 7 to 12 chevron shaped markings. Guanine on
eye iris, interopercle, opercle, subopercle, isthmus, 2nd to 4th
infraorbitals, lateral portion of parietals just behind eye, and
belly. Guanine more evident in MCP 38417, and MZUSP 87760
specimens. Holotype with some guanine.

Odontostilbe nareuda seems to have fewer dark chromato-
phores than similar species such as O. fugitiva, O. dierythrura,
and O. parecis, and another new species from río Madre de
Dios (in manuscript), all of these occur in the rio Madeira ba-
sin. Except for O. parecis from rio Guaporé basin, the other
three species were found to be sympatric with O. nareuda.

Sexual dimorphism. Only three males available, holotype and
two paratypes, but these are not fully mature, without com-
pletely developed hooks. These males have longer pectoral-
fin rays in contrast with specimens with undetermined sex,
statistically  significant  in  test  for  coincidental  regressions
(F(2, 276) = 28.5, p<0.00) (Fig. 23). The snout profile of holotype
is slightly protruded in comparison with the unsexed paratype
FMNH 106433 (Fig. 19). Gill gland not found in males of O.
nareuda. Absence of this gill gland probably explained by
lack of mature males among examined specimens.

Distribution. Odontostilbe nareuda is known from the lower
río Beni basin, in the ríos Nareuda and Muyumanu, of the ríos
Tahuamanu-Orthon drainage that runs parallel to the río Madre
de Dios, and the middle rio Madeira (Fig. 18). However, it may
be widespread in the rio Madeira basin. Some specimens from
the upper rio Mamoré basin were tentatively identified as O.
nareuda. Also, three specimens from the rio Purus match the

for males versus unsexed specimens of Odontostilbe nareuda.

larger anal-fin base diagnostic of O. nareuda. A somewhat
similar distribution was observed for Creagrutus occidaneus
that occurs in río Madre de Dios and upper rio Purus (Vari &
Harold, 2001). Further samples of these regions including
mature males and females are needed to assure these distri-
butions.

Etymology. In allusion to the type-locality, in the río Nareuda.

Ecological notes. FMNH field notes for O. nareuda indicate
that it occurs in oxbow lakes, river or small river habitats in
forest, having whitewater or turbid-white water. The bottom
was sandy or muddy substrate with sticks, logs, and leaves.
Nevertheless the río Nareuda is mostly a blackwater river as
noted by Machado-Alllison et al. (1999a), all the locality notes
of FMNH lots refer to whitewater, except FMNH 106430 which
mentions clearwater of brown color. The lower río Nareuda
seems to be influenced by whitewaters of the río Tahuamanu
- río Orthon basin. The FMNH specimens all came from the
AquaRAP expedition in the upper río Orthon basin, Bolívia.
These  specimens  were  originally  identified  as  Cheirodon
fugitiva, Odontostilbe fugitiva or Odontostilbe sp. (Chernoff
et al., 1999; Sarmiento et al., 1999). Specimens identified for
the AquaRAP expedition as O. paraguayensis, and listed as
that species by Willink et al. (1999) as “believed to be” a new
record for the Bolivian Amazon, actually are O. nareuda or an
undescribed  species  of  cheirodontine.  Both  species  were
collected  together,  being  probably  syntopic.  Machado-
Allison et al. (1999b) detailed the abundance of species re-
garding the field station that corresponds to FMNH lots of
the holotype and some paratypes (FMNH 106433) and cited
“O.  paraguayensis”  as  the  most  abundant  species,  and
“Cheirodon fugitiva” the fifth ranked, being “typically from
cochas or flooded lakes”.

(middle), female 41.6 mm SL (bottom).

Diagnosis. Differs from Amazonian species of Odontostilbe
by:  (1)  number  of  lower  gill  rakers  9-10  (vs. 11-14  in
Odontostilbe fugitiva and O. dierythrura, 10-11 in O. ecua-
dorensis, and 10-12 in O. nareuda) (Fig. 13a-b); (2) number of
branched anal-fin rays (20-21, vs. 23-26 in O. nareuda); (3)
terminal  mouth  (vs. conspicuous  subterminal  mouth  in  O.
euspilura); (4) longer upper jaw length 28.8-32.9% HL (vs.
23.4-30.0% HL in O. fugitiva, Fig. 25, or vs. 23.0-29.2% HL in
O. ecuadorensis); and (5) larger eye in males 38.9-40.8% HL

diameter (vs. 28.9-38.6% HL in O. fugitiva, Fig. 26, or vs. 33.3-
38.1% HL in O. ecuadorensis). The combination of the char-
acters listed above distinguishes  O.  parecis from all other
Odontostilbe species.

Description. Morphometric data given in Table 4. Largest
male reaching 35.0 mm SL, and female 41.6 mm SL. Body elon-

fin origin. Snout blunt, larger in males. Head profile pointed,
gently convex from snout to posterior tip of supraoccipital
bone. Dorsal profile ascends almost straight from that point
to dorsal-fin origin, sometimes with sligth depression at pos-
terior tip of supraoccipital; from dorsal-fin origin descends
almost straight to caudal peduncle. Ventral profile convex
from lower jaw to anal-fin origin, and straight along anal-fin
base. Caudal peduncle slightly longer than deep.

Head relatively small. Posterior margin of opercle sinusoi-
dal with upper portion concave and lower portion convex.
Mouth terminal. Maxilla short, terminating posteriorly at ver-
tical near anterior eye border, and ending at level equal to
inferior eye border, positioned at 45 degrees angle relative to
longitudinal body axis. Cleared and stained specimens (2).
Premaxillary teeth 5, bearing 8-10 cusps; midcentral cusp
longer than lateral cusps; smaller lateral cusps of each tooth
overlap cusps of adjacent teeth (Fig. 27). Premaxillary teeth
juxtaposed externally to dentary teeth, leaving premaxillary
tooth cusps exposed when mouth closed. Maxilla with 2-3
teeth bearing 7-9 cusps, usually decreasing cusp number to

posterior tip of maxilla. Dentary teeth 8-9 bearing 2-7 cusps,
gradually decreasing in size posteriorly, first 6-7 teeth large
with 6-7 cusps, following 2 small teeth with 2-5 cusps. Smaller
cusps of all dentary teeth overlaping adjacent teeth cusps,
usually not in posteriormost teeth. All dentary tooth cusps
slightly recurved towards interior of mouth.

Dorsal-fin rays ii(20) or 9(20). Dorsal-fin origin slightly
posterior to midlength of body, and slightly posterior to ver-
tical through pelvic-fin origin. Anal-fin rays v(20), 19(5), 20(8),
or 21(7). Anal-fin distal border concave, anterior 6-7 branched
rays longest. Pectoral-fin rays: i(20), 9(1), 10(7), 11(10), or
12(2). Unbranched pectoral-fin ray short of reaching or reach-

ing pelvic-fin origin, slightly extending beyond pelvic-fin ori-
gin in males. Pelvic-fin rays i(20), 6(1), or 7(19). Unbranched
dorsal or pelvic-fin rays not elongate in males. Lateral skin
border of unbranched pectoral-fin rays and unbranched pel-
vic-fin  rays  thickened  in  mature  males,  bearing  thin
laterodorsal projection of hard tissue covered with soft tis-
sue. Principal caudal-fin rays 19(20). Procurrent caudal-fin
rays: dorsal 10(2), 11(9), or 12(9); ventral 8(3), 9(15), or 10(2).
Anterior ventral procurrent caudal-fin rays distally bifurcated
or not. Caudal-fin ray flaps ventrally on 2nd -8th (mostly 4th-7th)

rays of upper lobe, and dorsally on 12th-16th (mostly 13th-15th)
rays of lower lobe. Adipose fin at vertical through last anal-
fin ray insertion.

Males with acute, retrorse hooks on posterior margin of
pelvic and anal-fin rays. One or two paired and unpaired hooks
per segment of lepidotrichia, on last unbranched anal-fin ray,
and 1st to 8th branched anal-fin rays, positioned at middistal
length of rays and usually not extending to ray tip; tiny hooks
can  be  present  up  to  16th  anal-fin  branched  ray,  occurring
distally on branches (up to 17th anal-fin branched ray in holo-
type). One or two unpaired hooks per segment of lepidotrichia
on 1st to 7th branched pelvic-fin rays, extending almost en-
tirely to distal ray tip (along midlenght of 1st branched pelvic-
fin ray). Few mature males available for description of hooks.
Type material from INPA contains males with more developed
hooks. Holotype with hooks on 2nd to 5th branched pelvic-fin
rays. Because available males are not fully mature, this spe-
cies could have typical elongation of unbranched dorsal and
pelvic-fin rays present in of Odontostilbe species.

Scales  cycloid;  lateral  line  complete  35(7)  or  37(1);
predorsal row 9(2), 10(12), or 11(3); scale rows between lat-
eral line and dorsal-fin origin 5(10) or 6(8); scale rows be-
tween lateral line and anal-fin origin 4(18); scale rows around
caudal peduncle 14(10). Triangular modified scale on pelvic
fin base extends posteriorly covering 1-2 scales (mostly 2).
Scales on anal-fin base 5-7 (partially missing in holotype).

Cleared  and  stained  specimens  (2):  supraneurals  4(2);
precaudal vertebrae, 15(1) or 16(1); caudal vertebrae 19(2).
Gill rakers (18 in alcohol, 2 c&s), upper 5(17) or 6(3), lower
9(12) or 10(8) (2 on hypobranchial). Upper gill rakers with
none or 1-3 recurved denticles along anterolateral border, and
none to 2 similar denticles on posterolateral border; lower gill
rakers with none to 5 recurved denticles on anterolateral bor-
der (1-4 anteriormost lower gill rakers with none to 2 denticles
on posterolateral border); excepting posteriormost lower gill
raker with 4 recurved denticles irregularly placed on lateral
surface (Fig. 28). All denticulation mostly on basal portion of
gill rakers.

Color in alcohol. General ground body color brownish or pale
yellow. Dorsum dark from head to caudal peduncle, chromato-
phores mostly on scale borders forming reticulated pattern.
Pigmented scales extend laterally on body below longitudinal
stripe, also on pseudotympanum area. Dorsal fin with scat-
tered chromatophores along all fin rays, more densely pigmented
along 1st and 2nd unbranched dorsal-fin rays. Pectoral and pel-
vic fins with scattered dark chromatophores, more numerous
on anteriormost portions of fins. Holotype with pelvic fin hya-
line. Anal fin mostly pigmented with chromatophores spread
on all fin rays, except at distal tips of last unbranched fin ray
and 1st branched fin ray. Adipose fin hyaline. Caudal fin al-
most entirely covered with diffuse chromatophores along fin
rays, clear areas on base of caudal-fin lobes just posterior to
caudal-fin spot. Rounded black to brown spot on base of cau-
dal fin, usually light near lower border, sometimes extending
little onto proximal portion of 7th to 12th central caudal-fin rays.

Redescription of the type species and description of three new species of Odontostilbe

Numerous  chromatophores  on  snout,  upper  and  lower
lips, anteriormost portion of maxilla and lower jaw, and 1st-2nd
infraorbitals.  Pigmentation  on  dorsal  surface  of  head  on
frontals and parietals, and deep-lying dark chromatophores
over brain membranes below frontals and parietals, and fon-
tanel. Body with faint dark midlateral stripe, sometimes re-
duced to line, along midlongitudinal body axis, beginning
posterior to or on pseudotympanum, above lateral line, reach-
ing caudal spot. Below lateral line, ventral body faint almost
without chromatophores. Pigmented area above anal-fin base
forming  10  to  11  chevron-shaped  markings.  Guanine  sur-
rounds eye iris, interopercle, opercle, ishtmus, and most 3rd
infraorbital.  Holotype  with  some  remaining  guanine,  but
fresher specimens of MCP without any guanine.

Sexual dimorphism. Males with anal- and pelvic-fin hooks
on  rays  as  previously  described,  such  hooks  absent  in  fe-
males. Gill gland (Burns & Weitzman, 1996) present in three
mature  males  of  Odontostilbe  parecis,  holotype,  and  two
paratypes (Fig. 28). Holotype of O. parecis with gill gland
present on first gill arch, covering about 9 anterior branchial
filaments. Paratype INPA 21425, a male 30.6 mm SL with a
gland  including  about  7  anterior  branchial  filaments  and
paratype MCP 37319, 39.0 mm SL with gland including about
6 anterior branchial filaments. Principal component analysis
of  morphometric  data  of  males  and  females  plus  unsexed
specimens shows sexual dimorphism in general body shape
(Fig. 29). Principal component 2 (PC2) grouped males and
females separately. This affected strongly and negatively by
caudal peduncle length, pectoral-fin length, pelvic-fin length,
and snout length; and positively by depth at dorsal-fin ori-
gin. Principal component 3 (PC3) affected strongly and posi-
tively  by  snout  length  and  caudal  peduncle  length,  nega-
tively by anal-fin base and pectoral-fin length. Males differed

data of males (M), females (F), and unsexed specimens (U) of

third principal components (PC2, PC3).

from females in all of these characters. Usually males with
higher mean values for peduncle length, pectoral-fin length,
pelvic-fin length, and snout length, while females and unsexed
specimens have higher depth at dorsal-fin origin than males
(Table 3). Unsexed specimens were not assumed to be fe-
males, because they probably also include immature males.
All examined males are probably not fully mature as men-
tioned in description. Additional material may reinforce sexual
morphometric characters described here.

Distribution. Upper rio Guaporé drainage, rio Galera and rio
Novo.

Etymology. The epithet parecis refers to the Chapada dos
Parecis, a plateau situated on the east of Guaporé tributaries
where the species was discovered.

Ecological notes. The Guaporé-Iténez is a clearwater right-
bank tributary of the major rio Madeira (Goulding et al., 2003).
Field notes record of MCP material: translucent water of quiet
to medium flow, sandy bottom with pebbles, and a depth of 1-
1.2 m. This was species collected along with Serrapinnus sp.

Discussion

Previous  phylogenetic  diagnosis  for  the  genus
Odontostilbe among cheirodontines was based on two sy-
napomorphies described in Malabarba (1998), and related to
the elongation of the second unbranched dorsal-fin ray and
the unbranched pelvic-fin ray of males. These characters were
found  homoplastic  in  “Odontostilbe” mitoptera  of  the
Compsurini.  Recognition  of  Odontostilbe separately  from
genera assigned to the tribes Cheirodontini and Compsurini
was also supported by the lack in  Odontostilbe species of
the several synapomorphies dignosing those tribes and their
included genera. These synapomorphies consist of primary
and  secondary  sexual  characters.  The  genera
Pseudocheirodon, Prodontocharax, Aphyocheirodon,  and
Cheirodontops also lack specialized sexually dimorphic fea-
tures present in the Compsurini and Cheirodontini and were
diagnosed based on jaws and teeth modifications, absent in
Odontostilbe.

The diagnosis of  Odontostilbe in  the  present  contribu-
tion follows that of Malabarba (1998), based on the analysis
of two Odontostilbe species only, O. fugitiva and O. pequira,
respectively the type species of the genera Odontostilbe and
Holoshesthes. Holoshesthes was placed in the synonym of
Odontostilbe.  We  found  morphological  diversity  in
Odontostilbe much larger than previously known. We recog-
nize in Odontostilbe six species of the ten species referred to
the genus by Malabarba (2003): O. fugitiva, O. dierythrura
Fowler,  1940,  O.  microcephala  Eigenmann,  1907,  O.
paraguayensis  Eigenmann  &  Kennedy,  1903,  O.  pequira
(Steindachner, 1882), and O. roloffi Géry, 1972 (actually a syn-
onym of O. euspilura, see below). This excludes the two spe-
cies of Central American compsurins provisionally kept in
Odontostilbe: “O.” dialeptura and “O.” mitoptera. Also, the
generic assignment of the two nominal species described by
Géry (1960) as Cheirodon (C. gracilis and C. gracilis littoris)
and latter transferred to  Odontostilbe by Planquette  et.  al.
(1996), deserve a separate revision and are not included in
Odontostilbe.

In a comprehensive taxonomic revision of Odontostilbe
in  progress  by  the  first  author,  10  additional  species  of
cheirodontines were found related to this genus, in addition
to the six species listed above and the three new species

described  herein. Among  these  10  species,  8  are  unde-
scribed, one is Odontostilbe pulchra (Gill, 1858) [left as spe-
cies  inquirenda  among  Cheirodontinae  by  Malabarba
(2003)], and the last one is Cheirodontops geayi Schultz,
1944, type species of Cheirodontops. Cheirodontops geayi
was not previously hypothesized as related to Odontostilbe,
although  Böhlke  (1954)  pointed  out  that  Cheirodontops
Schultz, 1944 was solely distinguished from Holoshesthes
Eigenmann, 1903 by the absence of teeth on the maxillary.
The examination of type material of C. geayi, and an exten-
sive  revision  of  the  species,  showed  that  the  teeth  are
present on the maxilla. Also it was found that the elongation
of dorsal- and pelvic-fin rays in mature males that diagnoses
Odontostilbe is present in Cheirodontops. Schultz (1944)
observed the resemblance of teeth between Cheirodontops
and Holoshesthes. Malabarba (1998) based on the phyloge-
netic  analysis  of  Cheirodontinae  placed  Holoshesthes  in
synonym of Odontostilbe, arguing that the character of the
presence of dentary teeth with at least five cusps, with the
three central cusps larger, compressed and in a row forming
a sharp cutting edge, was found to be ambiguous, and inde-
pendently acquired in four cheirodontine lineages. Eigen-
mann (1915), and Géry (1977) used this character alone to
distinguish Holoshesthes of Odontostilbe. Additional phy-
logenetic analysis of Odontostilbe is needed to clarify the
relationships  and  taxonomic  status  of  Holoshesthes  and
Cheirodontops.

Malabarba (2003) listed Deuterodon (Lobodeuterodon)
euspilurus Fowler, 1945, described from upper río Caquetá
basin, Colombia, as a junior synonym of O. fugitiva. Accord-
ing to work in progress by the senior author,  O. euspilura
(Fowler, 1945) is a valid species, and a senior synonym of O.
roloffi Géry, 1972 described from upper río Napo, Ecuador. A
full redescription of this species will be provided in a forth-
coming paper.

Almost all the mature males of the examined Odontostilbe
related  species  share  both  elongations  of  the  unbranched
dorsal- and pelvic-fin rays, excepting Odontostilbe euspilura
and an undescribed species from rio Uruguay basin that lack
the elongation of the second unbranched dorsal-fin ray. Two
other undescribed species from upper rio Paraná basin lack
both elongations, of unbranched dorsal- and pelvic-fin rays,
but there are few mature males available of them. Odontostilbe
pulchra  has  a  slight  elongation  of  the  second  unbranched
dorsal-fin ray only in some specimens, but has the unbranched
pelvic-fin ray elongate.

A reevaluation of the diagnosis of  Odontostilbe is still
needed  because  the  discovery  of  several  new  species  not
previously used in a phylogenetic analysis of the genus by
Malabarba  (1998).  The  discovery  of  new  data  regarding
Cheirodontops geayi indicating that it shares characters di-
agnosing Odontostilbe (elongation of the dorsal- and pelvic-
fin rays) requires a reanalysis of the phylogeny of these gen-
era of the Cheirodontinae. Also, such an analysis should in-
clude Lobodeuterodon (its type species) and Holoshesthes,
apparent junior synonyms of Odontostilbe.

to an anonymous reviewer. D. Stewart and R. Barriga pro-
vided invaluable specimens from Ecuador. W. Crampton and
R. Reis provided the color photo of O. fugitiva of Ucamara
project. F. Carvajal and F. Tejerina-Garro loaned material that
helped with distribution. M. S. Lucena helped with MNHN
loan, and V. Bertaco with MHNG loan. Thanks to J. Wingert,
T. Carvalho, and T. Salatino for MCP cataloguing, and A.
Charcansky for histological analysis. R. L. Pijnenburg checked
the  danish  translation.  Some  the  O.  parecis  material  was
caught during Transcontinental Expedition, supported by the
All Catfish Species Inventory project. SEM photographs were
taken at “Centro de Microscopia e Microanálises” - PUCRS
and “Centro de Microscopia Eletrônica” - UFRGS.
