Abstract. A rapid PCR-RFLP analysis was designed to identify 3 closely related species of hairtails: Trichiurus
lepturus, T. japonicus, and Trichiurus sp. 2, basing on partial sequence data (600 bp) of the mitochondrial DNA
encoding the 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) gene. Restriction digestion analysis of the unpurified PCR
products of these 3 species, using EcoRI and VspI endonucleases, generated reproducible species-specific
restriction patterns showing 2 fragments (250 bp and 350 bp) for T. lepturus in EcoRI digestion and 2 fragments
(196 bp and 404 bp) for T. japonicus in VspI digestion, whereas no cleavage was observed for Trichiurus sp. 2
in both EcoRI and VspI digestions. The PCR-RFLP technique developed in this study proved to be a rapid,
reliable and simple method that enables easy and accurate identification of these 3 closely related species of
the genus Trichiurus.

Key words: 16S rRNA, hairtails, species identification, PCR-RFLP, Trichiuridae.

Introduction

The family Trichiuridae (hairtails or cutlassfishes),
which comprises 9 genera and 32 species, are gener-
ally benthopelagic on continental shelves and slopes
and distributed in tropical to warm temperate waters
(Nakamura and Parin 1993). The taxonomic classifi-
cation of members of the genus Trichiurus is con-
fusing, because of their similar body shape and
coloration. They have long been considered as
“one variable species” (Tucker 1956), and
Trichiurus lepturus (type locality: South Carolina,
North America) was considered a single and valid
circum-global species in the most recent FAO re-
view by Nakamura and Parin (1993). Two species
of hairtails – Trichiurus japonicus and Trichiurus
sp. 2 – are most frequently and abundantly caught
hairtails
(Nakabo 2002)
and our recent genetic study involving the genetic
divergence and phylogenetic analysis of the par-

in Japanese waters

tial 16S rRNA gene showed that T. lepturus,
T. japonicus and Trichiurus sp. 2 are indeed 3 sep-
arate valid species (Chakraborty et al. in press).
Morphologically, these 3 species look very similar
except for coloration of the dorsal fin (yellow in
Trichiurus sp. 2 and white in both T. lepturus
and T. japonicus) and length of the tail (very long
in T. japonicus, medium in T. lepturus and short in
Trichiurus sp. 2). Although morphological fea-
tures are sufficient for species identification in
fresh specimens, it is difficult to identify the spe-
cies origin in processed products, such as fresh
and frozen fillets, since many of the distinguishing
morphological features are no longer detectable
after processing. In Japan, hairtail fillets are
mainly marketed as fresh or frozen; the fresh ones
are usually used for raw consumption called
“sashimi”, while the frozen fillets are used for ei-
ther boiled or grilled products (Mochijuki 1997).
Trichiurus sp. 2 enjoys a higher consumer prefer-

In recent years, DNA-based studies involving
PCR amplification of nuclear and mitochondrial
DNA,
genetic
divergences from the sequence data, are being
used to discriminate between closely related
species (Bourdy et al. 2003; Karaiskou et al. 2003;
Mabuchi et al. 2003), with regard to their
taxonomic
classification.
However, in the case of processed products, most
molecular biological methods used to verify
species identity are based on PCR amplification of

This method provides a simpler alternative to
costly DNA sequencing techniques and has been
widely used for species identification of many

DNA extraction, PCR amplification
and sequencing

Total DNA was extracted using a DNeasy Tissue
kit (Qiagen, Tokyo, Japan) from muscle tissues
preserved in 99.5% ethanol, according to the man-
ufacturer’s protocols. The partial 16S rRNA gene
(600 bp) was amplified using the following primers:
L2510 (5’-GCCTGTTTA ACAAAAACAT-3’) and
H3059 (5’-CGGTCTG AACTCAGATCACGT- 3’)
(Miya and Nishida, 1996). PCR amplification was
carried out in a 25-µL reaction volume containing
1X Taq DNA polymerase reaction buffer (Bioneer,
Korea), 5 µM of each dNTP (Bioneer, Korea),
0.40 µM of each primer, 0.125 U Taq DNA poly-
merase (Bioneer, Korea), and 1 µL of DNA tem-
plate in a Techgene thermocycler
(TC 312,
Techne, UK). The thermal cycling profile was as
follows: 94oC for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles of
denaturation at 94oC for 30 s, annealing at 55oC for
30 s and extension at 72oC for 1 min, with a final
extension for 5 min at 72oC. The PCR products
were electrophoresed on a 1.0% agarose gel,
stained with ethidium bromide (0.5 µg mL–1),
and visualized under a UV transilluminator in
a Digi Doc-It System (UVP, BioImaging system,
USA).

Double-stranded DNA products were purified by
Microcon 100 (Millipore, USA), and nucleotide se-
quences were determined by direct sequencing using
a Big Dye Terminator v 3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit
(Applied Biosystems, USA) in a PRISM 310 Ge-
netic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, USA), fol-
lowing manufacturer’s instructions. Primers used
were the same as those for PCR amplification.

Identification of restriction sites

in Trichiurus sp. 2 and T.

The sequence analysis data showed unique sites
for 2 restriction enzymes, EcoRI and VspI among
the 3 species. The restriction enzyme EcoRI pro-
duced 2 fragments of 250 bp and 350 bp in
T. lepturus, whereas its restriction site was not
present
japonicus.
The other restriction enzyme VspI produced 2
fragments of 196 bp and 404 bp in T. japonicus,
but
in
Trichiurus sp. 2 and T. lepturus. All the individual
specimens from each of the 3 species were used to
verify the sequence polymorphism of the mitochon-
drial 16S rRNA gene, and no mutation was observed
at the recognition sites of both restriction enzymes.

RFLP analysis

Restriction digestion of the PCR products for
the partial 16S rRNA gene from the 3 species was

carried out using EcoRI (Fermentas, Lithuania)
and VspI (Fermentas, Lithuania) endonucleases
separately in a 10-µL reaction mixture containing
1 × Buffer O+ (Fermentas, Lithuania), 5 µL of
unpurified PCR products, and 5 units of each
endonuclease at 37oC for 1 h. A 5-µL sample of
the reactant was run on a 2.0% agarose gel and vi-
sualized as described above.

Results and discussion

Figure 1 compares the aligned sequences of
the partial 16S rRNA gene of Trichiurus
sp. 2 (AB200990), T.
japonicus (AB200989)
and T. lepturus (AB201821), which enables iden-
tification of these 3 species. Direct digestion of
the PCR products separately with EcoRI and VspI
resulted in species-specific restriction patterns.
They corresponded to the expected profiles as de-
scribed above and using EcoRI, fragments of
around 250 bp and 350 bp were seen in T. lepturus
while an uncut fragment of around 600 bp was
seen in both Trichiurus sp. 2 and T. japonicus
(Figure 2). In the case of VspI, fragments of
around 200 bp and 400 bp were seen in
T. japonicus while an uncut fragment of around
600 bp was seen in Trichiurus sp. 2 and T. lepturus
(Figure 2).

In order

supermarkets

to verify the usefulness of

this
PCR-RFLP technique, fillet samples of hairtails
imported from various countries (like Indonesia,
Oman, Pakistan, Thailand and Canada) were pur-
chased from various
in Japan
and analyzed for species identification by this
technique. Restriction digestion with both EcoRI
and VspI showed that the samples obtained from
Indonesia, Oman, Pakistan and Thailand belonged
to Trichiurus sp. 2 (an uncut fragment of around
600 bp seen after restriction digestion with both
EcoRI and VspI), while the samples from Canada
belonged to T. lepturus (fragments of 250 bp
and 350 bp seen after EcoRI digestion but an uncut
fragment after VspI digestion). Representative re-
sults of the PCR-RFLP analysis of the fillets are
shown in Figure 3.

The RFLP results for the commercial fillets
were further verified by direct sequencing of
the PCR products from representative fillet sam-
ples. The fillet samples from Indonesia, Oman, Pa-
kistan and Thailand, identified as Trichiurus sp. 2,
showed a high homology of more than 99% with
Trichiurus sp. 2 (AB200990), with mutations at

ples from Canada, sequencing of the representa-
tive samples showed a high homology of more
than 99% with T.

the EcoRI site and absence of the VspI site.

The RFLP data obtained in this study attest to
the mistaken identity of hairtail species in se-
quence data submitted to the GenBank. The data-
base shows 3 partial 16S rRNA sequences
(AY16492, AY216493 and AY216494) submitted
as T. lepturus haplotypes. However, the restriction

over, the sequence similarity of these 3 sequences
to T. japonicus was higher than 99%. The similar
restriction pattern and high sequence similarity of
these 3 submitted sequences with T. japonicus se-
quences proved that the submitted sequences were
in fact from T. japonicus, and not from T. lepturus.
The PCR-RFLP analysis using EcoRI and VspI re-
striction enzymes can easily and effectively iden-
tify the 3 species without any need of sequencing
or phylogenetic analysis. The PCR-RFLP protocol
developed in this study proved to be a simple, reli-
able, rapid and cost-effective method, requiring
minimum experimental setup and enabling accu-
