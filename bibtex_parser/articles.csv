,Environmental Microbiology,,,Temperature controls on aquatic bacterial production and community dynamics in arctic lakes and streams,2010,"Adams, H.E.","Adams, H.E., Crump, B.C., Kling, G.W.",12(5):1319-1333,12,5,1319,1333,"Freshwater Ecology (Ecology,Environmental Sciences),Biogeography,(Population Studies),07502,Ecology: environmental biology -- General and methods,07514,,Ecology: environmental biology -- Limnology,10062,Biochemistry studies,-- Nucleic acids,purines and pyrimidines,16S rRNA,16S ribosomal RNA/dissolved organic matter/[carbon-14]-leucine,Alaska,USA,North America,Nearctic region/Toolik lake,Nearctic region,denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis,electrophoretic techniques,laboratory techniques,",false,"P>The impact of temperature on bacterial activity and community composition was investigated in arctic lakes and streams in northern Alaska. Aquatic bacterial communities incubated at different temperatures had different rates of production, as measured by 14C-leucine uptake, indicating that populations within the communities had different temperature optima. Samples from Toolik Lake inlet and outlet were collected at water temperatures of 14.2 degrees C and 15.9 degrees C, respectively, and subsamples incubated at temperatures ranging from 6 degrees C to 20 degrees C. After 5 days, productivity rates varied from 0.5 to similar to 13.7 mu g C l-1 day-1 and two distinct activity optima appeared at 12 degrees C and 20 degrees C. At these optima, activity was 2- to 11-fold higher than at other incubation temperatures. The presence of two temperature optima indicates psychrophilic and psychrotolerant bacteria dominate under different conditions. Community fingerprinting via denaturant gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of 16S rRNA genes showed strong shifts in the composition of communities driven more by temperature than by differences in dissolved organic matter source; e.g. four and seven unique operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were found only at 2 degrees C and 25 degrees C, respectively, and not found at other incubation temperatures after 5 days. The impact of temperature on bacteria is complex, influencing both bacterial productivity and community composition. Path analysis of measurements of 24 streams and lakes sampled across a catchment 12 times in 4 years indicates variable timing and strength of correlation between temperature and bacterial production, possibly due to bacterial community differences between sites. As indicated by both field and laboratory experiments, shifts in dominant community members can occur on ecologically relevant time scales (days), and have important implications for understanding the relationship of bacterial diversity and function.",false,

Data on respiration and microbial density are presented for a moist, high tussock site compared with a low, water saturated site. The density of bacteria and eukaryotic microbes was nearly equivalent at both sites and potentially could yield substantial release of respiratory CO2 with continued warming. Respiratory rates for soil from the high site were greater than the low. The Q(10) of 2.4 for the high tussock sample was approximately 1.3 x that of the low site sample (Q(10) of 1.7).",false,
